### [1] [Conservative Bias in Large Language Models: Measuring Relation Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08120)
*Toyin Aguda,Erik Wilson,Allan Anzagira,Simerjot Kaur,Charese Smiley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在关系提取任务中表现出明显的保守偏差，倾向于选择“无关系”标签，导致信息丢失。研究发现保守偏差比幻觉更常见，并通过SBERT和LLM提示量化了这种影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在关系提取任务中的保守偏差行为及其对信息丢失的影响，以理解模型在标签选择中的权衡。

Method: 通过多种提示、数据集和关系类型系统评估保守偏差，引入“霍布森选择”概念，并使用SBERT和LLM提示量化语义相似性。

Result: 保守偏差的发生频率是幻觉的两倍，且保守选择会导致显著的信息丢失。

Conclusion: LLMs的保守偏差在避免错误的同时也限制了信息的提取，需进一步优化模型以平衡准确性和信息量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced conservative bias in relation
extraction tasks, frequently defaulting to No_Relation label when an
appropriate option is unavailable. While this behavior helps prevent incorrect
relation assignments, our analysis reveals that it also leads to significant
information loss when reasoning is not explicitly included in the output. We
systematically evaluate this trade-off across multiple prompts, datasets, and
relation types, introducing the concept of Hobson's choice to capture scenarios
where models opt for safe but uninformative labels over hallucinated ones. Our
findings suggest that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination.
To quantify this effect, we use SBERT and LLM prompts to capture the semantic
similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and
labels generated from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts.

### [2] [QA-LIGN: Aligning LLMs through Constitutionally Decomposed QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08123)
*Jacob Dineen,Aswin RRV,Qin Liu,Zhikun Xu,Xiao Ye,Ming Shen,Zhaonan Li,Shijie Lu,Chitta Baral,Muhao Chen,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QA-LIGN是一种自动符号奖励分解方法，通过分解奖励机制中的每个原则，提高语言模型对齐的透明度和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于奖励的对齐方法将多样反馈压缩为单一标量奖励，导致目标不透明且难以解释。

Method: QA-LIGN通过为每个原则制定特定评估问题，并生成独立的奖励组件，取代传统的黑盒奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，QA-LIGN在透明度和适应性上优于传统方法，且性能与DPO基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: QA-LIGN为语言模型对齐提供了更可解释和可控的解决方案，且不影响任务性能。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models with explicit principles (such as
helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) is crucial for ensuring safe and
reliable AI systems. However, standard reward-based alignment methods typically
collapse diverse feedback into a single scalar reward, entangling multiple
objectives into one opaque training signal, which hinders interpretability. In
this work, we introduce QA-LIGN, an automatic symbolic reward decomposition
approach that preserves the structure of each constitutional principle within
the reward mechanism. Instead of training a black-box reward model that outputs
a monolithic score, QA-LIGN formulates principle-specific evaluation questions
and derives separate reward components for each principle, making it a drop-in
reward model replacement. Experiments aligning an uncensored large language
model with a set of constitutional principles demonstrate that QA-LIGN offers
greater transparency and adaptability in the alignment process. At the same
time, our approach achieves performance on par with or better than a DPO
baseline. Overall, these results represent a step toward more interpretable and
controllable alignment of language models, achieved without sacrificing
end-task performance.

### [3] [EconWebArena: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Economic Tasks in Realistic Web Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08136)
*Zefang Liu,Yinzhu Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EconWebArena是一个用于评估自主代理在复杂、多模态经济任务中的表现的基准测试，包含360个任务，强调权威数据源和基于网络的经济推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对权威数据源和多模态经济任务的覆盖，EconWebArena旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过大型语言模型生成候选任务，并经过人工筛选，构建包含360个任务的基准测试。评估多模态LLM在导航、数据提取等任务中的表现。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在接地性、导航和多模态理解方面存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: EconWebArena为经济网络智能提供了一个严格的测试平台，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on
complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark
comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains
such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task
challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual
content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive
data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting
multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by
rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability.
Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data
sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a
diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure
cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding,
plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial
performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation,
and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed
for economic web intelligence.

### [4] [Multilingual Hate Speech Detection in Social Media Using Translation-Based Approaches with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08147)
*Muhammad Usman,Muhammad Ahmad,M. Shahiki Tash,Irina Gelbukh,Rolando Quintero Tellez,Grigori Sidorov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力层和Transformer模型的多语言仇恨言论检测方法，并在英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的仇恨言论威胁在线安全和包容性，但乌尔都语的仇恨言论检测研究较少，尤其是基于翻译的方法。

Method: 使用注意力层增强特征提取，结合Transformer模型（如GPT-3.5 Turbo和Qwen 2.5 72B）和传统机器学习模型（如SVM）进行多语言仇恨言论检测。

Result: 在英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语数据集上，模型性能显著提升，F1分数分别达到0.87、0.85和0.81，多语言联合模型F1分数为0.88。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言仇恨言论检测提供了高效解决方案，有助于构建更安全的数字社区。

Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping
opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful
content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity.
While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like
English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using
translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual
dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and
Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced
distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology
leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate
speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature
extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including
GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models
like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators,
following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a
Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5
Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of
0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for
Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B).
These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline
0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM
baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline
0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech
detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

### [5] [ETT-CKGE: Efficient Task-driven Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08158)
*Lijing Zhu,Qizhen Lan,Qing Tian,Wenbo Sun,Li Yang,Lu Xia,Yixin Xie,Xi Xiao,Tiehang Duan,Cui Tao,Shuteng Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETT-CKGE提出了一种高效、任务驱动的持续知识图谱嵌入方法，通过可学习的任务驱动令牌实现知识迁移，显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在知识保留和计算效率上存在不足，尤其是手动设计的节点/关系重要性评分和计算开销大的图遍历问题。

Method: 引入可学习的任务驱动令牌，直接捕获任务相关信号，避免显式节点评分或遍历，通过简单的矩阵操作实现知识迁移。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，ETT-CKGE表现出优越或竞争性的预测性能，同时显著提高了训练效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: ETT-CKGE通过任务驱动令牌实现了高效且有效的知识迁移，解决了现有方法的效率与可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) seeks to integrate new knowledge
while preserving past information. However, existing methods struggle with
efficiency and scalability due to two key limitations: (1) suboptimal knowledge
preservation between snapshots caused by manually designed node/relation
importance scores that ignore graph dependencies relevant to the downstream
task, and (2) computationally expensive graph traversal for node/relation
importance calculation, leading to slow training and high memory overhead. To
address these limitations, we introduce ETT-CKGE (Efficient, Task-driven,
Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding), a novel task-guided CKGE
method that leverages efficient task-driven tokens for efficient and effective
knowledge transfer between snapshots. Our method introduces a set of learnable
tokens that directly capture task-relevant signals, eliminating the need for
explicit node scoring or traversal. These tokens serve as consistent and
reusable guidance across snapshots, enabling efficient token-masked embedding
alignment between snapshots. Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved
through simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and
memory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive
performance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability
compared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods. The code is available at:

### [6] [Can Artificial Intelligence Write Like Borges? An Evaluation Protocol for Spanish Microfiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08172)
*Gerardo Aleman Manzanarez,Nora de la Cruz Arana,Jorge Garcia Flores,Yobany Garcia Medina,Raul Monroy,Nathalie Pernelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出GrAImes协议，基于文学理论评估AI生成的微型小说的文学价值，包括主题一致性、文本清晰度、解释深度和美学质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI能生成叙事一致且语言连贯的短篇小说，但其文学价值（尤其是美学质量）的评估尚未得到充分关注。

Method: 提出GrAImes评估协议，结合文学理论，为AI生成的微型小说提供客观评估框架，并通过文学专家和爱好者验证。

Result: 验证结果显示GrAImes协议能有效评估微型小说的文学价值。

Conclusion: GrAImes协议为AI生成微型小说的文学价值评估提供了基础。

Abstract: Automated story writing has been a subject of study for over 60 years. Large
language models can generate narratively consistent and linguistically coherent
short fiction texts. Despite these advancements, rigorous assessment of such
outputs for literary merit - especially concerning aesthetic qualities - has
received scant attention. In this paper, we address the challenge of evaluating
AI-generated microfictions and argue that this task requires consideration of
literary criteria across various aspects of the text, such as thematic
coherence, textual clarity, interpretive depth, and aesthetic quality. To
facilitate this, we present GrAImes: an evaluation protocol grounded in
literary theory, specifically drawing from a literary perspective, to offer an
objective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction. Furthermore, we
report the results of our validation of the evaluation protocol, as answered by
both literature experts and literary enthusiasts. This protocol will serve as a
foundation for evaluating automatically generated microfictions and assessing
their literary value.

### [7] [LLM-BT: Back-Translation as a Framework for Terminology Standardization and Dynamic Semantic Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08174)
*Li Weigang,Pedro Carvalho Brom*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-BT利用大语言模型（LLMs）通过跨语言语义对齐自动化术语验证和标准化，解决了快速发展的技术领域中传统专家驱动标准化的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速发展的技术领域（如AI和量子计算）中，英语技术术语的快速增长使得传统的人工标准化方法难以保证多语言一致性。

Method: 提出LLM-BT框架，通过术语级一致性验证、多路径验证工作流和将回译视为动态语义嵌入，实现跨语言术语标准化。

Result: 实验表明，LLM-BT在术语一致性（90%以上匹配）和跨语言鲁棒性（BLEU > 0.45，葡萄牙语准确率100%）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: LLM-BT将回译转化为多语言术语标准化的主动引擎，支持人机协作，为全球科技领域的术语治理提供基础设施。

Abstract: The rapid growth of English technical terms challenges traditional
expert-driven standardization, especially in fast-evolving fields like AI and
quantum computing. Manual methods struggle to ensure multilingual consistency.
We propose \textbf{LLM-BT}, a back-translation framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) to automate terminology verification and standardization
via cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our contributions are: \textbf{(1)
Term-Level Consistency Validation:} Using English $\rightarrow$ intermediate
language $\rightarrow$ English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term
consistency across models (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek, Grok), with case studies
showing over 90\% exact or semantic matches. \textbf{(2) Multi-Path
Verification Workflow:} A novel ``Retrieve--Generate--Verify--Optimize''
pipeline integrates serial (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ ZHcn $\rightarrow$ ZHtw
$\rightarrow$ EN) and parallel (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ Chinese/Portuguese
$\rightarrow$ EN) BT routes. BLEU and term accuracy indicate strong
cross-lingual robustness (BLEU $>$ 0.45; Portuguese accuracy 100\%).
\textbf{(3) Back-Translation as Semantic Embedding:} BT is conceptualized as
dynamic semantic embedding, revealing latent meaning trajectories. Unlike
static embeddings, LLM-BT provides transparent path-based embeddings shaped by
model evolution. LLM-BT transforms back-translation into an active engine for
multilingual terminology standardization, enabling human--AI collaboration:
machines ensure semantic fidelity, humans guide cultural interpretation. This
infrastructure supports terminology governance across scientific and
technological fields worldwide.

### [8] [Unable to forget: Proactive lnterference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08184)
*Chupei Wang,Jiaqiu Vince Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在长上下文检索中易受干扰，导致准确性下降，提示工程效果有限，表明存在工作记忆瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在长上下文检索中的干扰效应及其与生成能力的关联。

Method: 采用认知科学中的主动干扰范式（PI），设计PI-LLM评估，测试LLMs在语义相关更新流中的检索表现。

Result: LLMs检索准确性随干扰累积呈对数线性下降，提示工程缓解效果有限。

Conclusion: LLMs存在干扰分离和信息灵活操作的基本限制，需增强抑制无关内容的能力。

Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly
recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup.
While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of
intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the
proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier
information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such
interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce
PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value
updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are
clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines
log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from
retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via
prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield
limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs'
ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information,
suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls
for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content
during retrieval.

*Samra Zafar,Shaheer Minhas,Syed Ali Hassan Zaidi,Arfa Naeem,Zahra Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用写作过程数据（如键盘记录和定期快照）改进LLM反馈的效果，发现学生更偏好基于过程的反馈，且某些编辑行为与高分相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的反馈仅基于最终文本，缺乏写作过程的上下文，无法反映学生的思考和修改过程。

Method: 开发了一个数字写作工具，记录学生的打字和文本演变过程，20名学生使用时限写作任务，LLM基于最终文本和完整写作痕迹生成反馈，学生评估反馈的实用性。

Result: 学生更偏好过程感知的LLM反馈，某些编辑行为（如添加内容或重组段落）与高分相关。

Conclusion: 让LLM更了解写作过程可以生成更有意义、个性化和支持性的反馈。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) like Gemini are becoming common tools for
supporting student writing. But most of their feedback is based only on the
final essay missing important context about how that text was written. In this
paper, we explore whether using writing process data, collected through
keystroke logging and periodic snapshots, can help LLMs give feedback that
better reflects how learners think and revise while writing. We built a digital
writing tool that captures both what students type and how their essays evolve
over time. Twenty students used this tool to write timed essays, which were
then evaluated in two ways: (i) LLM generated feedback using both the final
essay and the full writing trace, and (ii) After the task, students completed
surveys about how useful and relatable they found the feedback. Early results
show that learners preferred the process-aware LLM feedback, finding it more in
tune with their own thinking. We also found that certain types of edits, like
adding new content or reorganizing paragraphs, aligned closely with higher
scores in areas like coherence and elaboration. Our findings suggest that
making LLMs more aware of the writing process can lead to feedback that feels
more meaningful, personal, and supportive.

TL;DR: 本文综述了复合AI系统优化的最新进展，包括数值和语言技术，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复合AI系统的复杂性增加，优化其组件及交互成为新挑战，需探索新方法如自然语言反馈。

Result: 总结了优化复合AI系统的技术，并提出了开放研究挑战和未来方向。

Conclusion: 复合AI系统优化是一个快速发展的领域，需进一步研究以解决现有挑战。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led
to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows. By
integrating multiple components, compound AI systems have become increasingly
adept at performing sophisticated tasks. However, as these systems grow in
complexity, new challenges arise in optimizing not only individual components
but also their interactions. While traditional optimization methods such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain
foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new
approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper
provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI
systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We
formalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing
methods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges
and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. A list of surveyed papers
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiuLab/AISysOpt-Survey.

*Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Yupeng Cao,Haohang Li,Yangyang Yu,Nikhil Muralidhar,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM-BENCH是一个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在科学论文中提取和验证声明与证据能力的基准测试，揭示了LLMs在处理复杂科学内容时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs是否能够真正理解和处理科学论文中声明与证据之间的复杂关系，填补了这一领域的空白。

Method: 研究采用了三种启发自分治策略的方法，并在六种不同的LLMs上进行了系统性比较，包括封闭模型（如GPT-4和Claude）和开源模型。

Result: 结果显示，封闭模型在声明-证据识别任务中的精确率和召回率上表现优于开源模型，且三遍和逐个提示策略显著提升了LLMs的能力，但计算成本增加。

Conclusion: CLAIM-BENCH为评估LLMs的科学理解能力设定了新标准，并提供了诊断工具和改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex research
tasks such as literature review, idea generation, and scientific paper
analysis, yet their ability to truly understand and process the intricate
relationships within complex research papers, such as the logical links between
claims and supporting evidence remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
present CLAIM-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
capabilities in scientific claim-evidence extraction and validation, a task
that reflects deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation. We
systematically compare three approaches which are inspired by divide and
conquer approaches, across six diverse LLMs, highlighting model-specific
strengths and weaknesses in scientific comprehension. Through evaluation
involving over 300 claim-evidence pairs across multiple research domains, we
reveal significant limitations in LLMs' ability to process complex scientific
content. Our results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4 and
Claude consistently outperform open-source counterparts in precision and recall
across claim-evidence identification tasks. Furthermore, strategically designed
three-pass and one-by-one prompting approaches significantly improve LLMs'
abilities to accurately link dispersed evidence with claims, although this
comes at increased computational cost. CLAIM-BENCH sets a new standard for
evaluating scientific comprehension in LLMs, offering both a diagnostic tool
and a path forward for building systems capable of deeper, more reliable
reasoning across full-length papers.

### [12] [Automatic Generation of Inference Making Questions for Reading Comprehension Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08260)
*Wanjing Anya Ma,Michael Flor,Zuowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了阅读理解中推理能力的重要性，提出了一种推理类型分类法，并利用GPT-4o生成诊断性阅读理解题目，实验表明自动生成与人工判断结合具有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理能力是阅读理解的核心但复杂技能，诊断性题目能帮助教育者提供针对性指导。

Method: 提出推理类型分类法，分析题目分布，使用GPT-4o通过少量示例生成题目，比较有无思维链提示的效果。

Result: GPT-4o生成93.8%高质量题目，但仅42.6%准确匹配目标推理类型。

Conclusion: 自动生成与人工判断结合是高质量诊断性阅读理解评估的可扩展路径。

Abstract: Inference making is an essential but complex skill in reading comprehension
(RC). Some inferences require resolving references across sentences, and some
rely on using prior knowledge to fill in the detail that is not explicitly
written in the text. Diagnostic RC questions can help educators provide more
effective and targeted reading instruction and interventions for school-age
students. We introduce a taxonomy of inference types for RC and use it to
analyze the distribution of items within a diagnostic RC item bank. Next, we
present experiments using GPT-4o to generate bridging-inference RC items for
given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and
without chain-of-thought prompts. Generated items were evaluated on three
aspects: overall item quality, appropriate inference type, and LLM reasoning,
achieving high inter-rater agreements above 0.90. Our results show that GPT-4o
produced 93.8% good-quality questions suitable for operational use in grade
3-12 contexts; however, only 42.6% of the generated questions accurately
matched the targeted inference type. We conclude that combining automatic item
generation with human judgment offers a promising path toward scalable,
high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的数据质量直接影响其性能，但目前缺乏公开的高质量数据集。该报告旨在通过提供可持续、可追溯的数据集来填补这一空白。

Method: 与哈佛图书馆合作，从Google Books项目中提取、分析和处理公共领域的书籍，生成包含OCR文本和元数据的详细数据集。

Result: 发布了983,004卷公共领域书籍的数据集，涵盖242B tokens，包括原始和处理后的OCR文本及元数据。

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究者和开发者提供了高质量的历史文本资源，支持更透明和可持续的数据管理实践。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) use data to learn about the world in order to
produce meaningful correlations and predictions. As such, the nature, scale,
quality, and diversity of the datasets used to train these models, or to
support their work at inference time, have a direct impact on their quality.
The rapid development and adoption of LLMs of varying quality has brought into
focus the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality training data and
revealed an urgent need to ground the stewardship of these datasets in
sustainable practices with clear provenance chains. To that end, this technical
report introduces Institutional Books 1.0, a large collection of public domain
books originally digitized through Harvard Library's participation in the
Google Books project, beginning in 2006. Working with Harvard Library, we
extracted, analyzed, and processed these volumes into an extensively-documented
dataset of historic texts. This analysis covers the entirety of Harvard
Library's collection scanned as part of that project, originally spanning
1,075,899 volumes written in over 250 different languages for a total of
approximately 250 billion tokens. As part of this initial release, the
OCR-extracted text (original and post-processed) as well as the metadata
(bibliographic, source, and generated) of the 983,004 volumes, or 242B tokens,
identified as being in the public domain have been made available. This report
describes this project's goals and methods as well as the results of the
analyses we performed, all in service of making this historical collection more
accessible and easier for humans and machines alike to filter, read and use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理中常因过度思考导致冗余输出，影响效率。研究探讨显式自我反思是否必要。

Method: 提出NoWait方法，通过抑制推理中的显式自我反思标记（如“Wait”和“Hmm”）来简化推理过程。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，NoWait将推理轨迹长度减少27%-51%，且不影响模型性能。

Conclusion: NoWait是一种即插即用的高效多模态推理解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step
reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose
and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether
explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is
necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective
approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens
during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual,
visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought
trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without
compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for
efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在不同认知水平上的能力，填补医学领域中对LLMs多认知水平评估的空白。

Method: 提出一个多认知水平评估框架，整合现有医学数据集并设计针对三个认知水平的任务，评估六种主流LLM家族的表现。

Result: 发现模型在高认知水平任务中性能显著下降，模型规模在高认知水平任务中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要提升LLMs在高认知水平上的医学能力，为开发适用于实际医学应用的LLMs提供见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical benchmarks, but their capabilities across different cognitive
levels remain underexplored. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a
multi-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical
domain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and
introduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp,
comprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using
this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical
LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek.
Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity
increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role
in performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to
enhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides
insights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.

*Yiqun Sun,Qiang Huang,Anthony K. H. Tung,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文呼吁文本嵌入研究应超越表层语义，关注隐式语义，并提出改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本嵌入模型主要关注表层语义，忽视了隐式语义（如语用、说话者意图和社会文化背景），导致其在需要深层理解的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 通过试点研究展示现有模型在隐式语义任务上的局限性，并提出改进建议。

Result: 试点研究表明，即使是先进模型在隐式语义任务上表现仅略优于简单基线。

Conclusion: 建议研究应聚焦多样化训练数据、设计评估深层语义理解的基准，并将隐式语义作为核心建模目标。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the text embedding research community should
move beyond surface meaning and embrace implicit semantics as a central
modeling goal. Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,
powering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research
attention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level
semantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often
implicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.
Current embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth
and evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a
result, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker
stance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that
even state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic
baselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm
shift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically
grounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic
understanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling
objective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果归因的框架，用于识别Transformer中与行为相关的注意力头，通过VQ-AE量化注意力激活，评估行为相关性，提升推理时干预的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖表面线索或启发式规则，导致模块选择不准确或效果不佳，需更原则性的方法识别行为相关模块。

Method: 训练VQ-AE量化注意力头的激活，划分行为相关与无关子空间，通过分类指标评估行为相关性得分。

Result: 在七个LLM和五个行为数据集上验证，方法在真实性干预任务中表现优异，所选头具有跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的因果归因框架能更准确地识别行为相关注意力头，提升推理时干预效果，且具有泛化性。

Abstract: Inference-time steering aims to alter the response characteristics of large
language models (LLMs) without modifying their underlying parameters. A
critical step in this process is the identification of internal modules within
LLMs that are associated with the target behavior. However, current approaches
to module selection often depend on superficial cues or ad-hoc heuristics,
which can result in suboptimal or unintended outcomes. In this work, we propose
a principled causal-attribution framework for identifying behavior-relevant
attention heads in transformers. For each head, we train a vector-quantized
autoencoder (VQ-AE) on its attention activations, partitioning the latent space
into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces, each quantized with a
shared learnable codebook. We assess the behavioral relevance of each head by
quantifying the separability of VQ-AE encodings for behavior-aligned versus
behavior-violating responses using a binary classification metric. This yields
a behavioral relevance score that reflects each head discriminative capacity
with respect to the target behavior, guiding both selection and importance
weighting. Experiments on seven LLMs from two model families and five
behavioral steering datasets demonstrate that our method enables more accurate
inference-time interventions, achieving superior performance on the
truthfulness-steering task. Furthermore, the heads selected by our approach
exhibit strong zero-shot generalization in cross-domain truthfulness-steering
scenarios.

TL;DR: CC-RAG通过引入因果链结构改进RAG，提升LLMs在专业领域中的因果推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在专业领域的因果推理能力不足，标准RAG缺乏结构化建模因果依赖的能力。

Method: CC-RAG结合零样本三元组提取和主题感知图链，构建DAG并通过前向/后向链指导生成。

Result: 在比特币价格波动和高雪氏病实验中，CC-RAG在链相似性、信息密度和词汇多样性上优于标准RAG和零样本LLMs。

Conclusion: 显式建模因果结构能提升LLMs生成答案的准确性和可解释性，尤其在专业领域。

Abstract: Understanding cause and effect relationships remains a formidable challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in specialized domains where
reasoning requires more than surface-level correlations. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy, but standard RAG pipelines treat
evidence as flat context, lacking the structure required to model true causal
dependencies. We introduce Causal-Chain RAG (CC-RAG), a novel approach that
integrates zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining into the
RAG pipeline, enabling structured multi-hop inference. Given a domain specific
corpus, CC-RAG constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of <cause, relation,
effect> triples and uses forward/backward chaining to guide structured answer
generation. Experiments on two real-world domains: Bitcoin price fluctuations
and Gaucher disease, show that CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot
LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity. Both
LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations consistently favor CC-RAG. Our results
demonstrate that explicitly modeling causal structure enables LLMs to generate
more accurate and interpretable responses, especially in specialized domains
where flat retrieval fails.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在长上下文窗口中存在性能退化问题，现有解决方案训练成本高，统计行为和成本效益方法未充分探索。

Method: 从解码角度识别了Posterior Salience Attenuation（PSA）现象，提出PCD方法，对比长文本和局部注意力的logits，利用大规模短到长训练的优势。

Result: 实验表明，PCD有效缓解注意力分数退化，在长上下文基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PCD是一种无需训练的高效方法，显著提升LLMs在长上下文中的表现。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) support long contexts, they struggle with
performance degradation within the context window. Current solutions incur
prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective
approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the
Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio
correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the
attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding
space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive
Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with
those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the
gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of
long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates
attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks.

Motivation: 由于Transformer的二次计算和线性内存复杂度，优化长上下文LLM推理变得重要。现有方法依赖粗略预测，准确性不足。

Method: 提出基于草稿模型的框架，包括SpecKV（优化KV缓存丢弃）和SpecPC（压缩提示词）。

Result: 实验表明，方法在准确性和效率上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 草稿模型在近似LLM推理中具有潜力，扩展了其传统用途。

Abstract: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory
complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value
(KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely
on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel
framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to
more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we
introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which
leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair
for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft
model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt
tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft
models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility
beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with
theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the
attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on
long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher
accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in
memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在单任务环境中缺乏复杂性，无法反映真实场景，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 设计了EIFBENCH基准，包含多任务场景和多种约束，并提出SegPO算法优化模型表现。

Result: 评估显示现有大语言模型在复杂指令下表现差异显著，需进一步优化。

Conclusion: EIFBENCH和SegPO为复杂任务环境下的模型评估和优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: With the development and widespread application of large language models
(LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands
higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise
workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks.
However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited
constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following
Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and
robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that
enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but
also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational
environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO)
algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task
workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance
discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex
instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization
to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

Method: 引入mSTEB基准，涵盖语言识别、文本分类、问答和翻译任务，评估了多种LLMs在多模态（语音和文本）任务中的表现。

Result: 评估显示高资源语言与低资源语言（尤其是非洲和美洲/大洋洲语言）间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 需更多投资以解决低资源语言在LLMs中的代表性不足问题。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a
wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However,
their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages.
For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In
this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to
evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language
identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks
on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading
LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open
models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in
performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for
languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more
investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器翻译中取得了显著进展，但如何充分发挥其潜力仍是一个挑战。现有多智能体翻译框架忽视了认知翻译研究的核心见解。

Method: TACTIC框架包含六个功能不同的智能体，分别负责起草、优化、评估、评分、上下文推理和外部知识收集，模拟人类翻译的认知过程。

Result: 实验表明，TACTIC在FLORES-200和WMT24基准测试中表现优异，超越GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: TACTIC通过认知理论指导的多智能体协作，显著提升了翻译质量，为LLMs在翻译任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language
processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there
has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing
the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies
have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into
collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation
quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing
multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from
cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators
employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free
translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating
outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed
multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with
Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six
functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in
human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,
evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By
simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC
effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation.
Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24
benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by
an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it
further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23. Code is available at

Method: 提出AutoMeco框架评估现有元认知指标，并提出无训练的MIRA策略优化这些指标。

Result: 实验在三个数学推理数据集和三种LLMs上验证了AutoMeco的合理性，并显示MIRA能更好评估LLMs的元认知能力。

Conclusion: AutoMeco和MIRA为LLMs的元认知能力评估和改进提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze
mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the
meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors),
which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation
present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer
correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level
analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM
meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses.
Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation
framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free
Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost
current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical
reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by
comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability
of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is a growing
urgency to enhance the interpretability of their internal knowledge mechanisms.
Consequently, many interpretation methods have emerged, aiming to unravel the
knowledge mechanisms of LLMs from various perspectives. However, current
interpretation methods differ in input data formats and interpreting outputs.
The tools integrating these methods are only capable of supporting tasks with
specific inputs, significantly constraining their practical applications. To
address these challenges, we present an open-source Knowledge Mechanisms
Revealer&Interpreter (Know-MRI) designed to analyze the knowledge mechanisms
within LLMs systematically. Specifically, we have developed an extensible core
module that can automatically match different input data with interpretation
methods and consolidate the interpreting outputs. It enables users to freely
choose appropriate interpretation methods based on the inputs, making it easier
to comprehensively diagnose the model's internal knowledge mechanisms from
multiple perspectives. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of
sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony
detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient
comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper
introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven
multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized
agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional
analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent
then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent
providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark
datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving
SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of
76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This
success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective
analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

Result: 研究结果为关注能源效率、可访问性或硬件限制的场景提供了实用参考。

Conclusion: 通过优化数值精度和并行化策略，可以降低领域适应的计算成本，促进资源有限环境下的模型适配。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly in terms of energy, hardware,
and annotated data, often resulting in a positionality rooted in predominant
cultures and values (Santy et al., 2023). Domain adaptation has emerged as a
promising strategy to better align models with diverse cultural and value
contexts (Hershcovich et al., 2022), but its computational cost remains a
significant barrier, particularly for research groups lacking access to
large-scale infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate how the use of different
numerical precisions and data parallelization strategies impacts both training
speed (as a proxy to energy and hardware consumption) and model accuracy, with
the goal of facilitating domain adaptation in low-resource environments. Our
findings are relevant to any setting where energy efficiency, accessibility, or
limited hardware availability are key concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法需要大量计算和数据资源进行重新训练，成本高昂。

Method: 利用PCA处理多头注意力层的矩阵乘积，并通过线性校准减少前馈网络层的误差累积。

Result: Olica在数据使用、GPU内存和运行时间上高效，且在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Olica提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的剪枝方法，适用于大型语言模型。

Abstract: Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs)
require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to
reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To
address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal
decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for
retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer
depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as
unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract
the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or
disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes
unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of
PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally,
to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward
network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct
the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging
singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares
problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage,
GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across
multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: U-CoT+框架为有害模因检测提供了一种高效、灵活且可解释的解决方案，适用于不同平台和地区的需求。

Abstract: Detecting harmful memes is essential for maintaining the integrity of online
environments. However, current approaches often struggle with resource
efficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment
in content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce
U-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely
on prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity
meme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual
descriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme
classification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual
content and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general
large language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we
further incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide
models' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows
for easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across
platforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and
explainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the

### [30] [Efficient Context Selection for Long-Context QA: No Tuning, No Iteration, Just Adaptive-$k$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08479)
*Chihiro Taguchi,Seiji Maekawa,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adaptive-$k$ retrieval是一种单次自适应检索方法，根据查询与候选段落相似度分布动态选择段落数量，无需额外训练或LLM推理，显著减少token使用并保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域问答中固定检索大小导致的token浪费或关键证据遗漏问题，提升自适应方法在聚合问答中的表现。

Method: 基于查询与候选段落相似度分布，动态选择段落数量，无需模型微调或额外LLM推理。

Result: 在事实性和聚合问答基准测试中，Adaptive-$k$匹配或优于固定$k$基线，token使用减少10倍，仍保留70%相关段落。

Conclusion: 动态调整上下文大小能更高效、准确地完成问答任务，适用于多种LCLM和嵌入模型。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs)
both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering
(QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem:
fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence.
Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM
prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA,
where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present
Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that
adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the
similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not
require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing
retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks,
Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x
fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant
passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models,
highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient
and accurate QA.

TL;DR: 本文指出现有文本到图像生成评估框架的不足，提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要依赖人类判断，忽略了评估框架的其他关键特性。

Method: 识别可靠评估的两个关键方面，实证分析当前主流框架的不足。

Result: 当前评估框架未能满足关键特性。

Conclusion: 提出改进图像-文本对齐评估的建议。

Abstract: Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match
textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of
image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations
primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical
properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first
identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then
empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to
fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models.
Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文首次大规模审计了参数在0.5到50亿之间的指令调优小型语言模型（SLMs），揭示了其在公平性和实用性上的表现。研究发现，Phi模型在高效和伦理NLP方面表现优异，而不同架构的模型在偏见上差异显著，量化压缩则带来复杂权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型语言模型（SLMs）在资源受限设备上的快速部署，其伦理风险尚未被充分理解。本文旨在填补这一研究空白，为公平高效的SLM部署提供指导。

Method: 研究对Qwen 2.5、LLaMA 3.2、Gemma 3和Phi家族的9个开源模型进行了大规模审计，使用BBQ基准在零样本提示下分析其公平性和实用性。

Result: 1. Phi模型在保持高F1分数（>90%）的同时表现出最小偏见；2. 不同架构模型的社会偏见差异显著，Qwen 2.5模型可能表现为虚假中立，而LLaMA 3.2模型则表现出更强的刻板偏见；3. 4-bit AWQ量化在LLaMA 3.2-3B中提高了模糊场景的F1分数，但在Phi-4-Mini中增加了7%以上的残疾相关偏见。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境中公平高效的SLM部署提供了实用指导，特别有助于小型企业和资源受限环境。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Small Language Models (SLMs) for on-device and
resource-constrained deployments has outpaced our understanding of their
ethical risks. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale
audit of instruction-tuned SLMs spanning 0.5 to 5 billion parameters-an
overlooked "middle tier" between BERT-class encoders and flagship LLMs. Our
evaluation includes nine open-source models from the Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma
3, and Phi families. Using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, we
analyze both utility and fairness across ambiguous and disambiguated contexts.
This evaluation reveals three key insights. First, competence and fairness need
not be antagonistic: Phi models achieve F1 scores exceeding 90 percent while
exhibiting minimal bias, showing that efficient and ethical NLP is attainable.
Second, social bias varies significantly by architecture: Qwen 2.5 models may
appear fair, but this often reflects vacuous neutrality, random guessing, or
evasive behavior rather than genuine ethical alignment. In contrast, LLaMA 3.2
models exhibit stronger stereotypical bias, suggesting overconfidence rather
than neutrality. Third, compression introduces nuanced trade-offs: 4-bit AWQ
quantization improves F1 scores in ambiguous settings for LLaMA 3.2-3B but
increases disability-related bias in Phi-4-Mini by over 7 percentage points.
These insights provide practical guidance for the responsible deployment of
SLMs in applications demanding fairness and efficiency, particularly benefiting
small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 研究LLMs对礼仪的文化敏感性，填补评估资源不足的空白。

Method: 构建EtiCor++语料库，设计评估任务和偏见度量指标。

Result: 实验显示LLMs对某些地区存在固有偏见。

Conclusion: EtiCor++为评估LLMs的礼仪知识和偏见提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have started analyzing the cultural sensitivity
of LLMs. In this respect, Etiquettes have been an active area of research.
Etiquettes are region-specific and are an essential part of the culture of a
region; hence, it is imperative to make LLMs sensitive to etiquettes. However,
there needs to be more resources in evaluating LLMs for their understanding and
bias with regard to etiquettes. In this resource paper, we introduce EtiCor++,
a corpus of etiquettes worldwide. We introduce different tasks for evaluating
LLMs for knowledge about etiquettes across various regions. Further, we
introduce various metrics for measuring bias in LLMs. Extensive experimentation
with LLMs shows inherent bias towards certain regions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于一致性驱动的原型提示框架，用于广义意图发现（GID），通过结合旧知识和新知识，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督方法依赖标注数据且难以处理域外意图，限制了实际应用。GID试图利用未标注数据发现新意图，但现有方法忽视了领域适应。

Method: 提出一致性驱动的原型提示框架，包括原型提示框架（迁移旧知识）和分层一致性约束（学习新知识）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基线方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且具有泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Intent detection aims to identify user intents from natural language inputs,
where supervised methods rely heavily on labeled in-domain (IND) data and
struggle with out-of-domain (OOD) intents, limiting their practical
applicability. Generalized Intent Discovery (GID) addresses this by leveraging
unlabeled OOD data to discover new intents without additional annotation.
However, existing methods focus solely on clustering unsupervised data while
neglecting domain adaptation. Therefore, we propose a consistency-driven
prototype-prompting framework for GID from the perspective of integrating old
and new knowledge, which includes a prototype-prompting framework for
transferring old knowledge from external sources, and a hierarchical
consistency constraint for learning new knowledge from target domains. We
conducted extensive experiments and the results show that our method
significantly outperforms all baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
results, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of
our methods. Our source code is publicly available at

Motivation: RAG方法中检索到的信息可能存在冲突，但目前缺乏对冲突类型的系统分类和评估模型处理冲突能力的基准。

Method: 提出知识冲突的分类法，创建CONFLICTS基准，并通过实验评估LLMs在冲突解决中的表现。

Result: LLMs在处理冲突时表现不佳，但显式推理提示能显著提升响应质量。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在冲突解决中的不足，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date
information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting
information and it remains unclear how models should address such
discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge
conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We
then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of
conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark
that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge
conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that
LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While
prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the
retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of
their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的后训练框架，通过对比推理反馈和残差嵌入细化策略，优化潜在推理轨迹，提升大语言模型的推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显式推理方法（如Chain-of-Thought）存在标记开销大和固定推理轨迹的问题，而潜在推理方法虽能避免这些问题，但缺乏有效的后训练更新机制。

Method: 提出两种策略：1）对比推理反馈，通过比较强/弱基线推理嵌入推断更新方向；2）残差嵌入细化，通过历史梯度渐进整合稳定更新。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中验证了框架的有效性，MathQA上实现了5%的准确率提升（无需额外训练）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过轻量级后训练优化潜在推理，显著提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key component of language understanding in Large Language
Models. While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit
intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed
reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in
latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning
processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit
outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning
embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate
solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training
framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel
strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning
embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update
directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which
stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical
gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and
case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA
without additional training.

<details>

Motivation: 传统语言关系分析方法依赖专家劳动且难以大规模应用，机器学习方法提供了新的数据驱动途径。

Method: 使用XLS-R自监督模型的语音嵌入，通过线性判别分析（LDA）聚类语言，并与谱系、词汇和地理距离比较。

Result: 嵌入距离与传统分类方法高度一致，能捕捉全局和局部语言模式，但可视化语言关系仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 语音嵌入为语言变异研究提供了可扩展方法，未来可扩展至低资源语言并整合社会语言学变异。

Abstract: Investigating linguistic relationships on a global scale requires analyzing
diverse features such as syntax, phonology and prosody, which evolve at varying
rates influenced by internal diversification, language contact, and
sociolinguistic factors. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer
complementary alternatives to traditional historical and typological
approaches. Instead of relying on expert labor in analyzing specific linguistic
features, these new methods enable the exploration of linguistic variation
through embeddings derived directly from speech, opening new avenues for
large-scale, data-driven analyses.
  This study employs embeddings from the fine-tuned XLS-R self-supervised
language identification model voxlingua107-xls-r-300m-wav2vec, to analyze
relationships between 106 world languages based on speech recordings. Using
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), language embeddings are clustered and
compared with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances. The results
demonstrate that embedding-based distances align closely with traditional
measures, effectively capturing both global and local typological patterns.
Challenges in visualizing relationships, particularly with hierarchical
clustering and network-based methods, highlight the dynamic nature of language
change.
  The findings show potential for scalable analyses of language variation based
on speech embeddings, providing new perspectives on relationships among
languages. By addressing methodological considerations such as corpus size and
latent space dimensionality, this approach opens avenues for studying
low-resource languages and bridging macro- and micro-level linguistic
variation. Future work aims to extend these methods to underrepresented
languages and integrate sociolinguistic variation for a more comprehensive
understanding of linguistic diversity.

Motivation: 测试LLMs在真实心理咨询场景中的行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 开发CounselBench，包含2,000个专家评估和120个对抗性问题，评估LLMs的响应质量和安全性。

Result: LLMs在感知质量上表现更好，但常被专家标记为存在安全隐患；LLM评判者易高估模型表现。

Conclusion: CounselBench为高风险的LLM心理健康应用提供了临床基准框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for use in mental
health support, yet their behavior in realistic counseling scenarios remains
largely untested. We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed
with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in
single-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000
expert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human
therapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six
clinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level
annotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in
perceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety
concerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that
LLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues
identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct
CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling
questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880
responses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns.
Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for
benchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.

Abstract: This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may
not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics,
resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such
behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named
CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases
inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests
that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training
sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders
with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best
performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue
of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained
salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in
this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is a socially sensitive and inherently subjective task,
with judgments often varying based on personal traits. While prior work has
examined how socio-demographic factors influence annotation, the impact of
personality traits on Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored.
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the role of persona
prompts in hate speech classification, focusing on MBTI-based traits. A human
annotation survey confirms that MBTI dimensions significantly affect labeling
behavior. Extending this to LLMs, we prompt four open-source models with MBTI
personas and evaluate their outputs across three hate speech datasets. Our
analysis uncovers substantial persona-driven variation, including
inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level
biases. These findings highlight the need to carefully define persona prompts
in LLM-based annotation workflows, with implications for fairness and alignment
with human values.

Motivation: 科学推理需要长链推理、领域术语知识和适应更新发现，RAISE旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: RAISE分为三步：问题分解、逻辑查询生成和逻辑检索，从非结构化语料库中检索逻辑相关文档。

Result: RAISE在科学推理基准测试中表现优于其他基线方法，检索的文档不仅领域相似，逻辑相关性也更强。

Conclusion: RAISE通过逻辑相关文档检索，提升了科学推理的效果。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning requires not only long-chain reasoning processes, but
also knowledge of domain-specific terminologies and adaptation to updated
findings. To deal with these challenges for scientific reasoning, we introduce
RAISE, a step-by-step retrieval-augmented framework which retrieves logically
relevant documents from in-the-wild corpus. RAISE is divided into three steps:
problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval. We
observe that RAISE consistently outperforms other baselines on scientific
reasoning benchmarks. We analyze that unlike other baselines, RAISE retrieves
documents that are not only similar in terms of the domain knowledge, but also
documents logically more relevant.

Motivation: 现有LLM的解码策略（如贪婪搜索、采样或重排序）缺乏任务特定目标的显式优化，限制了控制能力。

Method: MEMETRON利用混合元启发式算法（GENETRON和ANNETRON），在LLM的奖励模型和上下文操作指导下搜索响应空间。

Result: 在人类偏好对齐任务中，MEMETRON显著优于标准解码和重排序方法。

Conclusion: MEMETRON展示了在不重训练模型的情况下提升对齐效果的潜力，具有模块化和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both open-ended and
structured tasks, yet their inference-time behavior is still largely dictated
by heuristic decoding strategies such as greedy search, sampling, or reranking.
These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for
task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that
formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON
leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the
response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by
the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward
responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework
is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward
function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the
critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly
outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential
to improve alignment without model retraining.

Result: 在10个表格基准测试中，TableDreamer显著提升目标LLM（Llama3.1-8B-instruct）的准确率11.62%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TableDreamer通过弱点引导和渐进式合成，有效提升表格指令调优数据的多样性和效率，显著改进LLM性能。

Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods,
they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First,
they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding
tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in
table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase
of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored
for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues.
Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as
seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under
the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as
the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments
on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62%
(49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms
state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data. The

Conclusion: 生成式方法在低资源领域具有潜力，但需进一步优化以超越传统方法。

Abstract: We explore a generative relation extraction (RE) pipeline tailored to the
study of interactions in the intestinal microbiome, a complex and low-resource
biomedical domain. Our method leverages summarization with large language
models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via
instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show
that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and
guiding the model. However, BERT-based RE approaches still outperform
generative models. This ongoing work demonstrates the potential of generative
methods to support the study of specialized domains in low-resources setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型推理模型在多样化任务和领域中规则推理的泛化能力问题。

Method: 采用强化学习和动态采样策略，通过历史奖励更新采样权重，实现领域增强和灵活学习。

Result: 在ID和OOD任务上显著优于前沿大型推理模型，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RuleReasoner是一种简单有效的方法，能够提升小型推理模型的规则推理能力，并具有高效性和泛化优势。

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

*Soham Poddar,Paramita Koley,Janardan Misra,Sanjay Podder,Navveen Balani,Niloy Ganguly,Saptarshi Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）推理过程中的能源消耗问题，发现模型输出常包含冗余信息。通过提示工程策略，显著减少了响应长度并优化了能源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs推理过程消耗大量能源，而输出压缩领域研究较少。模型常生成过长且冗余的响应，亟需优化方法。

Method: 对12种解码器LLMs在5个数据集上进行了基准测试，定义了LLM响应中的六类信息。探索了提示工程策略以减少响应长度。

Result: 适当的提示策略可减少25-60%的能源消耗，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 提示工程是优化LLM能源效率的有效方法，未来可进一步探索输出压缩技术。

Abstract: A significant portion of the energy consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
arises from their inference processes; hence developing energy-efficient
methods for inference is crucial. While several techniques exist for inference
optimization, output compression remains relatively unexplored, with only a few
preliminary efforts addressing this aspect. In this work, we first benchmark 12
decoder-only LLMs across 5 datasets, revealing that these models often produce
responses that are substantially longer than necessary. We then conduct a
comprehensive quality assessment of LLM responses, formally defining six
information categories present in LLM responses. We show that LLMs often tend
to include redundant or additional information besides the minimal answer. To
address this issue of long responses by LLMs, we explore several simple and
intuitive prompt-engineering strategies. Empirical evaluation shows that
appropriate prompts targeting length reduction and controlling information
content can achieve significant energy optimization between 25-60\% by reducing
the response length while preserving the quality of LLM responses.

*Ruiran Su,Jiasheng Si,Zhijiang Guo,Janet B. Pierrehumbert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClimateViz是首个大规模科学图表事实核查基准，包含49,862个与2,896个可视化图表关联的声明，评估了多模态语言模型在图表推理上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学事实核查主要关注文本和表格，忽略了科学图表的重要性。

Method: 引入ClimateViz基准，评估多模态语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现。

Result: 当前模型在图表推理上表现不佳，最佳模型准确率为76.2-77.8%，远低于人类水平（89.3-92.7%）。

Conclusion: 图表推理是当前模型的短板，解释增强输出可部分提升性能，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking
scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and
statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark
for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz
contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support,
refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example
includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons,
and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models,
including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning:
even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to
77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3
and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some
models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

*Hee Suk Yoon,Eunseop Yoon,Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson,Sungwoong Kim,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConfPO是一种基于训练策略置信度的偏好学习方法，专注于优化对偏好影响最大的token，无需额外模型或计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO）对所有token进行均匀调整，可能导致效率低下或过优化问题，而ConfPO旨在通过针对性优化提升对齐质量。

Method: ConfPO仅依赖训练策略的置信度识别关键token，并高效利用KL散度预算进行优化，避免使用额外模型或计算资源。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard等基准测试中，ConfPO表现优于均匀调整方法，且无额外计算开销。

Conclusion: ConfPO是一种简单、轻量且高效的方法，显著提升了LLM的偏好对齐质量。

Abstract: We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language
Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based
solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary
models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token
probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses
optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves
alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by
using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent
token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators,
raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,
lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment
benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO
consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better
alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自然语言推理（NLI）的合规检测方法EXCLAIM，通过多跳推理解释和追踪合规性，并利用大语言模型生成保证案例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂系统合规性检测中的法律与技术文本复杂性、模型解释需求及保证案例数据不足的问题。

Method: 将保证案例的声明-论据-证据结构建模为多跳推理，利用大语言模型生成案例，并提出覆盖率和结构一致性指标。

Result: 通过GDPR要求生成的保证案例在多跳推理任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: NLI方法在自动化合规检测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the
validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some
challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and
technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to
assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on
Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with
Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the
claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference
for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited
number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models
(LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural
consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case
from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our
results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the
regulatory compliance process.

*Mehedi Hasan Bijoy,Dejan Porjazovski,Tamás Grósz,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种语言感知的多教师知识蒸馏方法，用于构建多语言语音情感识别系统，性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管单语言语音情感识别（SER）取得了进展，但构建多语言系统仍具挑战性。目标是训练一个能够处理多语言SER的单一模型。

Method: 利用Wav2Vec2.0作为单语言教师模型的基础，通过语言感知的多教师知识蒸馏方法，将知识蒸馏到一个多语言学生模型中。

Result: 学生模型在英语数据集上的加权召回率为72.9，芬兰语数据集上的未加权召回率为63.4，优于微调和知识蒸馏基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升悲伤和中性情绪的识别上表现优异，但在识别愤怒和快乐情绪上仍有挑战。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for improving human-computer
interaction. Despite strides in monolingual SER, extending them to build a
multilingual system remains challenging. Our goal is to train a single model
capable of multilingual SER by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher
models. To address this, we introduce a novel language-aware multi-teacher
knowledge distillation method to advance SER in English, Finnish, and French.
It leverages Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation of monolingual teacher models and
then distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model. The
student model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with a weighted recall
of 72.9 on the English dataset and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on the Finnish
dataset, surpassing fine-tuning and knowledge distillation baselines. Our
method excels in improving recall for sad and neutral emotions, although it
still faces challenges in recognizing anger and happiness.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在金融文档数值问答任务中的表现，提出了一种改进的批评代理和计算器代理，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在金融文档的数值问答任务中表现不佳，尤其是缺乏真实标签时，传统批评代理性能下降。

Method: 提出改进的批评代理和计算器代理，并研究其交互对性能的影响。

Result: 新方法优于现有技术（如程序思维），且更安全。

Conclusion: 改进的代理方法在无真实标签情况下表现更优，交互研究为未来工作提供方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous
natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical
question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual
data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e.,
self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this
framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic
agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that
this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in
mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent
which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought)
and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each
other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

TL;DR: 研究分析10年间10万篇AI论文，发现跨学科团队虽更倾向关注社会伦理，但纯计算机科学团队在此领域的贡献正快速增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI发展如何与伦理和社会价值对齐，以及跨学科合作是否在实践中推动这一趋势。

Method: 开发分类器识别论文中的社会内容，分析2014-2024年ArXiv上的AI论文。

Result: 跨学科团队仍更关注社会伦理，但纯计算机科学团队在此领域的贡献显著增加。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了跨学科团队主导社会伦理AI的假设，并引发对技术团队主导的伦理研究及其对AI治理影响的思考。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become deeply embedded in everyday
life, calls to align AI development with ethical and societal values have
intensified. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key
pathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether
interdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice.
This study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between
2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are
integrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify
societal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these
considerations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain
more likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only
teams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output.
These teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers
and tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare
and misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the
drivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the
implications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most
societally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical
teams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a
technical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive
perspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种针对核应用领域的特定大型语言模型，基于公开的Essential CANDU教材构建，采用紧凑的Transformer架构，单GPU训练以保护核操作中的敏感数据。尽管数据集较小，模型在捕捉专业核词汇方面表现良好，但生成文本有时缺乏句法连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种符合严格网络安全和数据保密标准的内部LLM解决方案，专注于核领域内容。

Method: 基于Transformer架构，使用单GPU训练，数据集来自Essential CANDU教材。

Result: 模型能够捕捉专业核词汇，但生成文本有时不连贯。初步成功展示了其在专业任务中的实用性。

Conclusion: 未来方向包括扩展数据集、优化预处理和指令微调，以提升模型在核领域的准确性，并评估其在实际应用中的准备情况。

Abstract: This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear
applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook.
Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a
single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations.
Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of
capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes
lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this
approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with
rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in
text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while
also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing,
and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions
include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining
tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's
readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核工业中存在大量非结构化文本数据，但这些数据无法直接用于需要结构化问答对的LLM任务。合成数据生成可以填补这一空白。

Method: 利用LLMs分析文本、提取关键信息、生成相关问题，并评估合成数据集的质量。

Result: 合成数据能够将现有文本转化为可用的问答对，解决了数据稀缺和隐私问题。

Conclusion: 合成数据为核工业中的LLM应用铺平了道路，提升了信息检索、知识共享和决策能力。

Abstract: The nuclear industry possesses a wealth of valuable information locked away
in unstructured text data. This data, however, is not readily usable for
advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications that require clean, structured
question-answer pairs for tasks like model training, fine-tuning, and
evaluation. This paper explores how synthetic data generation can bridge this
gap, enabling the development of robust LLMs for the nuclear domain. We discuss
the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns inherent in the nuclear
industry and how synthetic data provides a solution by transforming existing
text data into usable Q&A pairs. This approach leverages LLMs to analyze text,
extract key information, generate relevant questions, and evaluate the quality
of the resulting synthetic dataset. By unlocking the potential of LLMs in the
nuclear industry, synthetic data can pave the way for improved information
retrieval, enhanced knowledge sharing, and more informed decision-making in
this critical sector.

influence its effectiveness. We use a sentence embedding based k-nearest
neighbour method to retrieve the suitable demonstrations for ICL. The selected
demonstrations, along with the test samples, are structured within a template
as input to the LLM. We then conduct a systematic study to analyse the impact
of factors related to demonstration selection and prompt context on DST
performance. This work is conducted using the MultiWoZ2.4 dataset and focuses
primarily on the OLMo-7B-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于函数调用的大型语言模型（LLM）方法，替代传统的自然语言转SQL（NL-to-SQL）方法，以提高核电站数据查询的准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL-to-SQL方法在核电站等关键系统中存在风险，如生成的SQL查询难以验证，且复杂数据库结构增加了错误几率。

Method: 通过预定义一组经过专家审核的专用函数，封装已验证的SQL逻辑，避免直接生成SQL查询。

Result: 研究表明，该方法在准确性和可维护性上优于直接NL-to-SQL生成。

Conclusion: 论文强调了在用户易用性和操作安全性之间平衡的重要性，并提供了一个可操作的框架。

Abstract: Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional
accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports.
Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been
explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses
significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and
legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured --
complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These
challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the
approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging
function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.
Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,
purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed
by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid
approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by
ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before
deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and
maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist
in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on
validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison
between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach,
highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work
underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational
safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in
critical systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning
abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their
performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects,
and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis
on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP
tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on
datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for
linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments
reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context
examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification
tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection
from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures
outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on
complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning
yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent
increases in model scale. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法，从法律文件中提取交通事故信息，包括伤残百分比和赔偿金额。通过文本分割和实体提取，比较了传统方法和基于语义搜索的方法，后者结合LLMs显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从法律文件中提取交通事故信息对保险公司成本量化至关重要，但由于法院判决的复杂论证，这一过程极具挑战性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）文本分割（正则表达式或语义搜索）；2）对选定段落使用LLMs（如LLaMA-2、LLaMA-3、GPT-4 Turbo）进行实体提取，并对部分模型进行微调。

Result: 基于语义搜索和LLMs的方法显著优于传统方法（39.5%）。微调后的LLaMA-2 70B达到79.4%，LLaMA-3 8B基础模型表现接近（76.6%），GPT-4 Turbo最高（86.1%）。

Conclusion: 语义搜索结合LLMs的方法显著提升提取准确性，尤其是微调后的模型和最新基础模型（如LLaMA-3）。

Abstract: The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is
crucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as
percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved
compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the
subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is
proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant
segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two
methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a
second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are
then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches
(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models
(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to
the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning
is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a
significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important
contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these
hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The
performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent
use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an
accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning
achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%.
Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned
LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model
development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 瑞士德语缺乏标准化书写形式，现有数据集在自然对话语音中表现不佳，需要更真实的数据集来提升语音识别效果。

Method: 使用SRB-300数据集（包含39个电台和电视台的真实长音频）微调多个Whisper模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在WER上提升了19%-33%，BLEU分数提高了8%-40%，最佳模型large-v3的WER为17.1%，BLEU为74.8%。

Conclusion: SRB-300数据集和微调方法显著提升了瑞士德语语音识别性能，对低资源语言的语音识别系统发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Swiss German is a low-resource language represented by diverse dialects that
differ significantly from Standard German and from each other, lacking a
standardized written form. As a result, transcribing Swiss German involves
translating into Standard German. Existing datasets have been collected in
controlled environments, yielding effective speech-to-text (STT) models, but
these models struggle with spontaneous conversational speech.
  This paper, therefore, introduces the new SRB-300 dataset, a 300-hour
annotated speech corpus featuring real-world long-audio recordings from 39
Swiss German radio and TV stations. It captures spontaneous speech across all
major Swiss dialects recorded in various realistic environments and overcomes
the limitation of prior sentence-level corpora.
  We fine-tuned multiple OpenAI Whisper models on the SRB-300 dataset,
achieving notable enhancements over previous zero-shot performance metrics.
Improvements in word error rate (WER) ranged from 19% to 33%, while BLEU scores
increased between 8% and 40%. The best fine-tuned model, large-v3, achieved a
WER of 17.1% and a BLEU score of 74.8. This advancement is crucial for
developing effective and robust STT systems for Swiss German and other

*Danush Khanna,Krishna Kumar,Basab Ghosh,Vinija Jain,Vasu Sharma,Aman Chadha,Amitava Das*

TL;DR: 论文揭示了LLM在对抗性攻击中的几何盲点，提出了ALKALI对抗性基准和GRACE防御框架，显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性威胁对LLM的防御提出了更高要求，当前防御方法存在几何盲点，无法识别潜在伪装。

Method: 提出ALKALI对抗性基准和GRACE框架，通过几何表示增强和潜在空间正则化来防御攻击。

Result: GRACE框架将攻击成功率降低了39%，并提出了AVQI指标量化潜在对齐失败。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLM的潜在伪装漏洞，并提出了有效的防御方法和评估工具。

Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses
can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial
prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe
representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface
level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to
the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated
adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts
across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.
Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates
(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying
vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where
adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate
this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware
Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning
with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent
separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion
among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled
embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry
without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.
Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent
alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when
unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens
into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.

TL;DR: PlantBert是一个基于DeBERTa架构的植物科学领域专用语言模型，专注于从植物应激反应文献中提取结构化知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物科学领域缺乏针对性的语言模型工具，PlantBert旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于DeBERTa架构，结合规则增强的语言后处理和本体实体归一化，使用专家标注的语料库进行微调。

Result: PlantBert在实体识别和语义关系捕捉方面表现出色，展示了在低资源科学领域的强大适应性。

Conclusion: PlantBert为农业NLP提供了可扩展的解决方案，推动了植物科学领域的数据驱动研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed
breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however,
plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In
this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model
specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant
stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its
disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned
on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary
focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic
stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with
rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity
normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful
relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is
annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology,
encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of
plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across
entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in
low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible
framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical
gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems
in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is
publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary
innovation in computational plant science.

Method: 采用结构化流程，将规范性语言分解为原子片段，提取义务规则，并评估其语法和语义一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，机器生成的形式化表示与专家手工制作的表示具有良好一致性，表明LLMs在有效提示下可显著提升法律信息学的可扩展性。

Conclusion: LLMs在法律文本语义分析中具有潜力，特别是在有效提示策略下，能够为法律信息学提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the automated semantic analysis of legal texts
using large language models (LLMs), targeting their transformation into formal
representations in Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL). We propose a structured
pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets,
extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic
coherence. Our methodology is evaluated across various LLM configurations,
including prompt engineering strategies, fine-tuned models, and multi-stage
pipelines, focusing on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications
Consumer Protections Code. Empirical results demonstrate promising alignment
between machine-generated and expert-crafted formalizations, showing that LLMs
- particularly when prompted effectively - can significantly contribute to
scalable legal informatics.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（包括高资源语言的方言）在自然语言理解系统中的困难，通过方言到标准语的标准化提升下游工具的使用效果。

Method: 结合基于规则的语言学转换和大型语言模型（LLMs）的少样本提示，无需平行数据。

Result: 在希腊方言数据集上验证了方法的有效性，发现之前的研究仅依赖表面语言信息，而新方法能保留更多语义。

Conclusion: 新方法为方言标准化提供了有效途径，同时揭示了之前研究的局限性。

Abstract: Natural language understanding systems struggle with low-resource languages,
including many dialects of high-resource ones. Dialect-to-standard
normalization attempts to tackle this issue by transforming dialectal text so
that it can be used by standard-language tools downstream. In this study, we
tackle this task by introducing a new normalization method that combines
rule-based linguistically informed transformations and large language models
(LLMs) with targeted few-shot prompting, without requiring any parallel data.
We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of
regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use
this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results
regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information,
including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made
through the remaining semantics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术无法支持基于注入知识的推理，限制了模型的应用范围。

Method: 扩展MEND的元目标，通过超网络学习梯度修改，使模型能回答涉及注入知识的多跳问题。

Result: 在RippleEdit数据集上表现优异，多跳问题准确率提升近2倍；在未见实体-关系对上也优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PropMEND在知识传播方面表现突出，但在未见关系上的性能下降，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject
knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on
propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require
reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach
for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify
gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to
propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that
gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop
questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the
RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop
questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We
further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the
generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along
relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still
outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the
performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating
knowledge to a wide range of relations.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理等任务上表现出色，但其训练通常需要高昂的计算资源。本文旨在证明即使资源有限，也能训练出高性能模型。

Method: 结合强化学习和内存优化技术，在单张RTX 3080 Ti（16GB显存）上训练1.5B参数的数学推理模型。

Result: 该模型在数学推理基准测试中表现优于或媲美规模更大的模型，证明了资源受限环境下高性能AI研究的可行性。

Conclusion: 研究打破了高性能数学推理模型必须依赖大规模基础设施的固有观念，为资源有限的研究者提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
various tasks including mathematical reasoning, their development typically
demands prohibitive computational resources. Recent advancements have reduced
costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end
hardware clusters. In this paper, we demonstrate that a single average gaming
GPU can train a solid mathematical reasoning model, by integrating
reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we
train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB
memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained
environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing
access to high-performance AI research.

Method: 提出FaithfulRAG框架，显式建模参数知识与检索内容的差异，设计自思考过程，让模型在生成前推理并整合冲突事实。

Result: 实验表明，FaithfulRAG优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaithfulRAG有效解决了知识冲突问题，提升了检索增强语言模型的忠实性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating
outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it
with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases
of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s
parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict
context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding
strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve
faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which
undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of
misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a
novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling
discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context.
Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level
and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and
integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is
available at https:// github.com/DeepLearnXMU/Faithful-RAG

Motivation: 探究LLMs在政治领域中的知识管理能力，尤其是在面对错误信息时是否能纠正用户错误信念。

Method: 通过直接知识问题和预设错误信息的引导性问题，评估LLMs的知识水平和政治偏见对其表现的影响。

Result: 发现LLMs在纠正用户错误信念和建立共同基础方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: 研究结果对LLMs在政治信息传播中的可靠性提出了质疑，尤其是在减少错误信息方面的作用。

Abstract: Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing
interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect
knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper
investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases
where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain
where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the
ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that
presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to
engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to
their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight
significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false
user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in
political discourse.

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分捕捉数值嵌入的正弦模式结构，导致对LMs算术错误的解释不足。

Method: 提出一种新探测技术，解码输入嵌入中的数值，验证LMs对数字的精确表示能力。

Result: 新探测技术能近乎完美地解码数值，且嵌入的精确度解释了LMs在基础算术中的大部分错误。

Conclusion: 通过对齐嵌入与探测发现的模式，可以缓解LMs的算术错误。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing
work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models'
representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent
unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact
quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate
for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal
patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values
from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source
LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with
remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged
by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary
arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered
by our probe can mitigate these errors.

Motivation: 现有移动代理主要关注原子任务，而忽略了组合任务的实际需求，UI-NEXUS填补了这一空白。

Method: UI-NEXUS设计了三种组合操作类别，并在本地和在线应用中评估移动代理。AGENT-NEXUS通过动态分解任务提升性能。

Result: 现有代理在组合任务上表现不佳，AGENT-NEXUS将任务成功率提高了24%至40%。

Conclusion: UI-NEXUS为组合任务提供了有效评估工具，AGENT-NEXUS显著提升了移动代理的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been
developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work
has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks
and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to
compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This
work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile
agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,
Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in
20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online
Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates
with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a
range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that
UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents
generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting
representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and
attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.
Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient
scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS
extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing
long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS
achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on
compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without
significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code

Conclusion: 该任务在早期检测认知衰退和NCD方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and
slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and
significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has
suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In
this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for
this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented
Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning
classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and
demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under
the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as
NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test).
Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected
by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with
language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal
gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the
naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related
cognitive decline and NCD.

ecologically-valid child vocalizations across an unprecedented sample,
comprising children acquiring 25+ languages in the U.S., Bolivia, Vanuatu,
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The dataset contains 242,004
labeled vocalizations, magnitudes larger than previous work. Models were
trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature (consonant+vowel), and
immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Models trained on the dataset
outperform state-of-the-art models trained on previous datasets, achieved
classification accuracy comparable to humans, and were robust across rural and

Conclusion: SWE-Flow为TDD任务提供了高效的数据合成方法，并公开了代码、数据集和模型以促进研究。

Abstract: We introduce **SWE-Flow**, a novel data synthesis framework grounded in
Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike existing software engineering data that
rely on human-submitted issues, **SWE-Flow** automatically infers incremental
development steps directly from unit tests, which inherently encapsulate
high-level requirements. The core of **SWE-Flow** is the construction of a
Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG), which precisely captures function interactions,
enabling the generation of a structured, step-by-step *development schedule*.
At each step, **SWE-Flow** produces a partial codebase, the corresponding unit
tests, and the necessary code modifications, resulting in fully verifiable TDD
tasks. With this approach, we generated 16,061 training instances and 2,020
test instances from real-world GitHub projects, creating the **SWE-Flow-Eval**
benchmark. Our experiments show that fine-tuning open model on this dataset
significantly improves performance in TDD-based coding. To facilitate further

Abstract: The present study extends recent work on Universal Dependencies annotations

L2-Korean corpus by annotating 2,998 new sentences from argumentative essays.
To evaluate the impact of XPOS-UPOS alignments, we fine-tune L2-Korean
morphosyntactic analysis models on datasets both with and without these

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large
language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically
aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using
verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in
math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple
sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that
takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer,
optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments
on multiple reasoning datasets show that SSA outperforms other test-time
scaling methods such as reward model-based re-ranking. Our approach also shows
a promising generalization ability, across sample set sizes, base model
families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs
to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the
outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类和LLM校对在提升第二语言写作可读性上的效果，发现两者均能改善词汇特征，但LLM更倾向于生成性修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类与不同LLM（ChatGPT-4o、Llama3.1-8b、Deepseek-r1-8b）在校对第二语言写作时的表现差异。

Method: 分析人类和LLM校对对词汇和句法特征的干预效果，评估三款LLM的一致性。

Result: 人类和LLM均能提升词汇连贯性，但LLM更倾向于使用多样词汇和复杂句法。三款LLM在主要特征上表现一致。

Conclusion: LLM校对在词汇和句法修改上更具生成性，且不同模型间表现一致。

Abstract: This study examines the lexical and syntactic interventions of human and LLM
proofreading aimed at improving overall intelligibility in identical second
language writings, and evaluates the consistency of outcomes across three LLMs
(ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b). Findings show that both human and
LLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to
better coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However,
LLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking
vocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and
sophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective
modifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in
major lexical and syntactic features across the three models.

TL;DR: Router-R1是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过动态路由和聚合多个LLM的能力，优化复杂任务的性能与成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由器通常仅支持单轮一对一映射，无法充分利用多个LLM的互补优势，限制了处理复杂任务的能力。

Method: Router-R1将多LLM路由和聚合建模为序列决策过程，利用LLM的推理能力交替进行内部思考和动态模型调用，并通过轻量级规则奖励（格式、结果、成本）指导学习。

Result: 在七个通用和多跳QA基准测试中，Router-R1优于多个基线，表现出卓越的性能、泛化能力和成本管理。

Conclusion: Router-R1通过强化学习优化性能与成本权衡，为多LLM协作任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the
development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.
However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one
mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),
which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the
complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that
formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.
Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its
reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with
"route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into
its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based
reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost
reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway
toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions
only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example
performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.
Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1
outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while
maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视觉和文本任务中的性能差异，通过分析任务特定计算子图（circuits）并提出一种无需训练的方法来缩小差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在视觉任务（如图像计数）和文本任务（如文本计数）中表现存在显著差异，研究旨在揭示这种差异的原因并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过比较不同模态中的任务特定计算子图（circuits），发现其功能相似但处理方式不同；提出将视觉数据令牌的表示从后期层修补到早期层。

Result: 实验表明，该方法平均缩小了模态间性能差距的三分之一。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs多模态性能差异的原因，并提出了一种无需训练的有效干预方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions
on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher
accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a
text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the
\textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different
modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between
modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences
lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a
text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they
become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations
only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence
subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual
data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with
multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the
performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on
the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach
for reducing it.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的生物力学算法，结合人机交互机制，提高AR手术导航中变形建模的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在计算效率和应对大解剖变化方面存在不足，影响AR手术导航的可靠性。

Method: 结合数据驱动的生物力学算法和人机交互机制，动态修正解剖对齐。

Result: 算法平均目标配准误差为3.42 mm，结合交互框架后降至2.78 mm，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了变形建模的效率和准确性，增强了手术导航的可靠性。

Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ
models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize
critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling
is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment
between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the
finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high
computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing
algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced
by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical
correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we
propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy
while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel
human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables
surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,
thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt
dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available
dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration
error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive
framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our
framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while
enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more
reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶在罕见场景中性能显著下降，且视觉语言模型存在领域差距、维度不匹配和模仿学习局限。

Method: 三阶段训练：1）用大规模驾驶问答数据集训练VLM；2）扩散规划器进行模仿学习；3）强化学习微调。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中PDMS达89.6，超越之前SOTA 5.6分。

Conclusion: ReCogDrive通过多阶段训练有效提升自动驾驶在罕见场景的性能和安全性。

Abstract: Although end-to-end autonomous driving has made remarkable progress, its
performance degrades significantly in rare and long-tail scenarios. Recent
approaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world
knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from
several limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data
of VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the
discrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation
learning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which
may be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an
autonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which
adopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a
large-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating
the domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving
scenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform
imitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to
continuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using
reinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model
to generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our
approach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6
and setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA
by 5.6 PDMS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I系统训练数据偏向欧美文化，忽视了全球南方的文化多样性，CuRe旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用维基媒体知识图谱构建包含300个文化物品的层次化数据集，通过文本条件增量分析评估系统表现。

Result: CuRe评分与人类对感知相似性、图像-文本对齐和文化多样性的判断高度相关，适用于多种T2I系统和视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: CuRe为T2I系统的文化多样性评估提供了可扩展且细粒度的工具，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Popular text-to-image (T2I) systems are trained on web-scraped data, which is
heavily Amero and Euro-centric, underrepresenting the cultures of the Global
South. To analyze these biases, we introduce CuRe, a novel and scalable
benchmarking and scoring suite for cultural representativeness that leverages
the marginal utility of attribute specification to T2I systems as a proxy for
human judgments. Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy
built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural
artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes
(food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's
categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing
their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling
fine-grained cultural comparisons. We empirically observe much stronger
correlations of our class of scorers to human judgments of perceptual
similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity across image encoders
(SigLIP 2, AIMV2 and DINOv2), vision-language models (OpenCLIP, SigLIP 2,
Gemini 2.0 Flash) and state-of-the-art text-to-image systems, including three
variants of Stable Diffusion (1.5, XL, 3.5 Large), FLUX.1 [dev], Ideogram 2.0,

Motivation: 现有的语义分割模型依赖高质量标注数据，但地面实况数据的不完整或不足会影响模型性能。基础设施网络（如运河和道路）具有图级特性（如可达性或连通性），可用于优化地面实况。

Method: IGraSS结合了多模态（RGB、NDWI、DEM）的语义分割模块和图基优化的地面实况细化模块，通过迭代处理提升网络识别精度。

Result: 实验表明，IGraSS将不可达运河段从18%降至3%，且使用优化后的地面实况显著提升运河识别效果。框架在道路网络中也表现出通用性。

Conclusion: IGraSS为噪声地面实况的优化和遥感图像中的基础设施网络映射提供了鲁棒框架，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including
irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic
segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,
well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate
ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks
have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or
connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground
truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a
semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,
DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module
processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on
the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show
that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and
training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.
IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and
mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example,
applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高起始频率下的雷达信号处理存在相位混叠和子区间模糊问题，传统方法难以解决。SpINRv2旨在通过神经网络框架提升重建精度。

Method: 提出了一种完全可微的频率域前向模型，结合隐式神经表示（INR）进行连续体积场景建模。通过频谱直接监督和稀疏性、平滑性正则化解决子区间模糊问题。

Result: 实验表明，SpINRv2在高频条件下显著优于传统和学习基线方法，为基于神经雷达的3D成像设立了新标准。

Conclusion: SpINRv2通过频率域建模和正则化技术，有效解决了高起始频率下的重建问题，为雷达3D成像提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric
reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar.
Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that
allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and
sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully
differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar
response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural
representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike
time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency
spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to
disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions.
Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical
and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes,
establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于离散扩散框架和视觉-语言-动作（VLA）管道的方法，用于建模外科医生的个性化操作风格，同时关注隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统常忽略外科医生的个性化操作风格，而本文旨在通过多模态输入（如内窥镜视频、手术意图语言等）建模这种个性化信号。

Method: 采用离散扩散框架，结合VLA管道，将手势预测建模为结构化序列去噪任务，并通过自然语言提示编码个性化风格。

Result: 在JIGSAWS数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够准确重建手势序列并学习到独特的运动指纹。同时发现个性化嵌入会提高任务性能，但也增加身份泄露风险。

Conclusion: 个性化嵌入虽能提升性能，但需平衡隐私风险，尤其是在手术建模中。

Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training,
experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this
personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained,
surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion
framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method
formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task,
conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent
language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill.
Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts
using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual
behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on
the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture
sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon.
To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership
inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task
performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage.
These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve
performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing
the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical
modeling. Code is available at:

Result: 在Visual Genome、Open Images V6和PSG数据集上验证了预训练VLMs的关系理解能力。

Conclusion: Open-World SGG展示了预训练VLMs在零样本关系理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Scene-Graph Generation (SGG) seeks to recognize objects in an image and
distill their salient pairwise relationships. Most methods depend on
dataset-specific supervision to learn the variety of interactions, restricting
their usefulness in open-world settings, involving novel objects and/or
relations. Even methods that leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs)
typically require benchmark-specific fine-tuning. We introduce Open-World SGG,
a training-free, efficient, model-agnostic framework that taps directly into
the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to produce scene graphs with zero additional
learning. Casting SGG as a zero-shot structured-reasoning problem, our method
combines multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and a lightweight
pair-refinement strategy, enabling inference over unseen object vocabularies
and relation sets. To assess this setting, we formalize an Open-World
evaluation protocol that measures performance when no SGG-specific data have
been observed either in terms of objects and relations. Experiments on Visual
Genome, Open Images V6, and the Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) dataset demonstrate
the capacity of pretrained VLMs to perform relational understanding without
task-level training.

Motivation: 解决多对象场景中DVP的局限性，改进训练效率，提升分解和重建能力。

Method: 扩展DVP架构，引入潜在空间损失函数，提出新基准Multi-dSprites，与MONet和LIVE对比。

Result: DVP在重建质量和对象分解能力上优于基线模型，训练效率显著提升。

Conclusion: DVP扩展有效，潜在空间损失函数和可解释性改进训练，但可微分渲染仍有局限性。

Abstract: This study builds on the architecture of the Disentangler of Visual Priors
(DVP), a type of autoencoder that learns to interpret scenes by decomposing the
perceived objects into independent visual aspects of shape, size, orientation,
and color appearance. These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which
control a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that
the model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In
this study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects
in a scene. We also exploit the interpretability of its latent by using the
decoder to sample additional training examples and devising alternative
training modes that rely on loss functions defined not only in the image space,
but also in the latent space. This significantly facilitates training, which is
otherwise challenging due to the presence of extensive plateaus in the
image-space reconstruction loss. To examine the performance of this approach,
we propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the
previously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We
compare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and
demonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to
decompose overlapping objects. We also analyze the gradients induced by the
considered loss functions, explain how they impact the efficacy of training,
and discuss the limitations of differentiable rendering in autoencoders and the
ways in which they can be addressed.

Abstract: Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs)
demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true
understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric
reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ
comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including
Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and
compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through
systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry
detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we
reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art
reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to
reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models
effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they
falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation,
such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit
remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting
basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is
publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address
critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in
robust, geometry-aware representation learning.

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made
significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the
somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we
investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text
encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training
and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of
different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12
different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could
impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract
embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal
that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to
inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and
find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly
improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning
outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced
visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

Abstract: In recent years the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite
images along with the advancement of computer vision models have enabled the
remote monitoring of the surface area of wetlands. However, these models
require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow
and expensive to produce. To overcome this problem, self-supervised training
methods have been deployed to train models without using annotated data. In
this paper we use a combination of deep clustering and negative sampling to
train a model to segment radar satellite images into areas that separate water
from land without the use of any manual annotations. Furthermore, we implement
an ensemble version of the model to reduce variance and improve performance.
Compared to a single fully-supervised model using the same architecture, our
ensemble of self-supervised models achieves a 0.02 improvement in the
Intersection Over Union metric over our test dataset.

*Octave Mariotti,Zhipeng Du,Yash Bhalgat,Oisin Mac Aodha,Hakan Bilen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过将2D关键点提升到3D空间来学习密集语义对应的方法，无需显式3D监督或相机标注，并在新数据集上验证了其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督方法局限于稀疏标注的关键点，泛化能力不足，需要一种能学习密集对应且无需额外监督的方法。

Method: 利用单目深度估计将2D关键点映射到3D空间，构建连续规范流形捕捉对象几何。

Result: 模型在未见关键点上显著优于监督基线，且无监督基线在跨数据集泛化中表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效学习鲁棒对应关系，且无监督方法在泛化性上优于监督方法。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence (SC) aims to establish semantically meaningful
matches across different instances of an object category. We illustrate how
recent supervised SC methods remain limited in their ability to generalize
beyond sparsely annotated training keypoints, effectively acting as keypoint
detectors. To address this, we propose a novel approach for learning dense
correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using
monocular depth estimation. Our method constructs a continuous canonical
manifold that captures object geometry without requiring explicit 3D
supervision or camera annotations. Additionally, we introduce SPair-U, an
extension of SPair-71k with novel keypoint annotations, to better assess
generalization. Experiments not only demonstrate that our model significantly
outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, highlighting its
effectiveness in learning robust correspondences, but that unsupervised
baselines outperform supervised counterparts when generalized across different
datasets.

TL;DR: 论文分析了17个用于评估视觉语言模型组合理解能力的基准测试，揭示了其设计中的偏见，并提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示现有视觉语言组合理解基准测试的设计缺陷和偏见，以推动更鲁棒的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析数据来源和构建过程（如负样本生成），发现基准测试中的分布不对称问题，并提出改进建议。

Result: 发现基准测试易受简单启发式方法攻击，未能有效衡量组合理解能力。

Conclusion: 建议改进基准测试设计以减少偏见，提升评估的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We investigate 17 benchmarks (e.g. SugarCREPE, VALSE) commonly used for
measuring compositional understanding capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs). We scrutinize design choices in their construction, including data
source (e.g. MS-COCO) and curation procedures (e.g. constructing negative
images/captions), uncovering several inherent biases across most benchmarks. We
find that blind heuristics (e.g. token-length, log-likelihood under a language
model) perform on par with CLIP models, indicating that these benchmarks do not
effectively measure compositional understanding. We demonstrate that the
underlying factor is a distribution asymmetry between positive and negative
images/captions, induced by the benchmark construction procedures. To mitigate
these issues, we provide a few key recommendations for constructing more robust
vision-language compositional understanding benchmarks, that would be less
prone to such simple attacks.

TL;DR: 1D图像分词器通过高度压缩的一维序列表示图像，支持启发式操作实现图像编辑和生成，无需训练生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索1D图像分词器在高度压缩下的表达能力，实现图像编辑和生成能力。

Method: 利用向量量化的1D分词器，通过启发式操作（如复制和替换）和梯度优化的测试时令牌优化。

Result: 实现了细粒度图像编辑和多样化、逼真的样本生成，适用于修复和文本引导编辑。

Conclusion: 1D图像分词器在压缩和表达性方面具有潜力，支持无需生成模型的图像编辑和生成。

Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged
tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly
compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find
that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector
quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through
heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude
manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent
representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring
appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D
tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging
gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss
functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is
demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can
generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any
generative model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage是一个音频到视频的基础模型，能够根据音频输入生成逼真、富有表现力的视频，尤其擅长生成人物说话的A-roll视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成方法要么忽略音频专注于无声图像序列生成，要么局限于特定应用领域（如重新配音），缺乏通用的音频到视频生成方案。

Method: 提出了一种统一的训练方法，基于自注意力机制，支持从零开始训练或基于现有权重微调，无需依赖特定于音频的架构或损失组件。

Result: Mirage生成的视频在主观质量上优于其他方法，能够生成与输入音频相匹配的逼真人物表演视频。

Conclusion: Mirage为通用的音频到视频生成提供了高效解决方案，展示了其在多模态视频生成中的潜力。

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and
consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the
harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we
see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either
ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation
or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application
domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation
model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from
scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech
synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal
video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and
conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people
delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input
audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training
self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or
given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as
an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior
subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or
loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio
are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage
for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEMA的新型注意力机制，解决了传统注意力机制在计算复杂度和聚焦能力上的不足，并在图像分类任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制在计算机视觉任务中存在计算复杂度高（二次复杂度）和线性注意力无法有效聚焦的问题。

Method: 通过数学定义广义注意力，提出SEMA机制，利用标记定位避免分散并保持聚焦，同时通过算术平均捕获全局注意力。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k上的分类结果表明，SEMA在更大规模的图像上优于线性注意力和近期视觉Mamba模型。

Conclusion: SEMA是一种可扩展且高效的注意力机制，为计算机视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic
computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the
inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for
computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized
attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention
within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses,
that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal
weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent
development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba
like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and
maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic
averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on
Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and
effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision
Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter
sizes.

Abstract: Reflection removal technology plays a crucial role in photography and
computer vision applications. However, existing techniques are hindered by the
lack of high-quality in-the-wild datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel
paradigm for collecting reflection datasets from a fresh perspective. Our
approach is convenient, cost-effective, and scalable, while ensuring that the
collected data pairs are of high quality, perfectly aligned, and represent
natural and diverse scenarios. Following this paradigm, we collect a
Real-world, Diverse, and Pixel-aligned dataset (named OpenRR-1k dataset), which
contains 1,000 high-quality transmission-reflection image pairs collected in
the wild. Through the analysis of several reflection removal methods and
benchmark evaluation experiments on our dataset, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in improving robustness in challenging real-world environments.

TL;DR: STNet通过创新的空间-光谱Transformer模块，有效解决了高光谱图像分类中的过拟合和泛化能力问题，性能优于主流方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高维数据、地物稀疏分布和光谱冗余等挑战，导致过拟合和泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出STNet网络架构，采用空间-光谱Transformer模块，通过解耦空间和光谱注意力及双重门控机制，实现高效特征提取与融合。

Result: 在IN、UP和KSC数据集上表现优异，超越主流方法。

Conclusion: STNet在不增加网络深度或宽度的情况下提升模型表征能力，适用于小样本和高噪声场景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image
classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground
objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification
overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract
and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image
(HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called
STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its
Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling
of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information
in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent
regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention
fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This
characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing
overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances
model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets,
outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用事件相机实时定位网球拍击球位置的方法，解决了高速相机内存消耗大和手动数字化耗时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在网球等球拍运动中，准确测量击球位置对分析球员表现和个性化装备设计至关重要，但现有方法存在内存消耗大和人工误差的问题。

Method: 通过事件相机高效捕捉亮度变化，结合传统计算机视觉技术和原创的事件处理（PATS）来识别击球时间、摆动范围和球拍轮廓。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在测量网球运动员表现时误差在允许范围内，且计算时间适合实时应用。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效、准确地实时定位击球位置，为球员表现分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: In racket sports, such as tennis, locating the ball's position at impact is
important in clarifying player and equipment characteristics, thereby aiding in
personalized equipment design. High-speed cameras are used to measure the
impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged
scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming
and prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively
capture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's
performance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the
racket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure
brightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed
motion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to
continuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method
consists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact,
and contours of ball and racket. Conventional computer vision techniques are
utilized along with an original event-based processing to detect the timing at
impact (PATS: the amount of polarity asymmetry in time symmetry). The results
of the experiments were within the permissible range for measuring tennis
players' performance. Moreover, the computation time was sufficiently short for
real-time applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Step AG的自适应引导策略，通过限制分类器自由引导在前几步去噪中，实现了20%至30%的速度提升，同时保持图像质量和文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类器自由引导方法在文本到视觉生成扩散模型中成本较高，现有自适应引导方法缺乏分析和实证支持，无法通用。

Method: 提出Step AG策略，限制分类器自由引导在前几步去噪中，适用于多种扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量与文本对齐上表现良好，速度提升20%至30%，且适用于不同设置和模型。

Conclusion: Step AG是一种简单、通用的自适应引导策略，显著提升了效率且不影响生成质量。

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models,
classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for
conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps
for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in
significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of
adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making
previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work,
we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step
AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our
evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results
indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several
denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned
images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is
consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various
models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our
method.

Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言框架通常采用统一的局部特征提取策略，忽视了不同模态的特定需求。

Result: 实验表明，MedMoE在多种医学基准测试中提升了对齐和检索性能。

Conclusion: MedMoE证明了模态专用视觉表示在临床视觉语言系统中的价值。

Abstract: Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at
varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained
localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the
medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction,
overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a
modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically
adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE
incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type,
which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches
trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate
over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling
spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework
produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions,
without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results
on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and
retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of
modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language
systems.

Abstract: When shooting electronic screens, moir\'e patterns usually appear in captured
images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir\'eing
methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir\'e. To address
the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir\'eing
(DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir\'e
removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the
two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image
generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir\'e exists in the W
image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an
efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into
an existing demoir\'eing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is
present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse
mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the
dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/Mrduckk/DCID.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the
performance of existing VLMs remains hindered by object hallucination, a
critical challenge to achieving accurate visual understanding. To address this
issue, we propose SECOND: Selective and Contrastive Decoding, a novel approach
that enables VLMs to effectively leverage multi-scale visual information with
an object-centric manner, closely aligning with human visual perception. SECOND
progressively selects and integrates multi-scale visual information,
facilitating a more precise interpretation of images. By contrasting these
visual information iteratively, SECOND significantly reduces perceptual
hallucinations and outperforms a wide range of benchmarks. Our theoretical
analysis and experiments highlight the largely unexplored potential of
multi-scale application in VLMs, showing that prioritizing and contrasting

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过结合物理模型和深度学习，该方法显著提升了无线电地图估计的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources
within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference
mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a
limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While
existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse
samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the
radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the
sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further
incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization
sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing
compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network
(RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter
adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio
propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to
adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by
the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate
obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic
decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor
prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the
performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）的性能依赖于高质量数据集，但存在图像与文本对齐噪声和文本模糊的问题，影响模型效果。

Method: SCALE通过跨模态评估框架，为数据条目分配任务、生成多类型描述，并评估对齐性、清晰度、任务稀有性、文本连贯性和图像清晰度。

Result: 研究发现，单模态质量评估方法可能低估特定任务关键样本，而适当生成的图像描述可将多模态任务转化为统一文本模态。

Conclusion: SCALE为提升VLM性能提供了一种高效的数据选择方法，解决了现有数据集中的关键问题。

Abstract: The application of visual instruction tuning and other post-training
techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in visual understanding, enriching Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with
more comprehensive visual language datasets. However, the effectiveness of VLMs
is highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise
recognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1)
noisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to
misinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual
content. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data
quality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data
selection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE
integrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data
entry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and
task-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates
the alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each
entry based on the generated captions. We reveal that: (1) current unimodal
quality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest,
which can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the
lower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately
generated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text
multimodal task into a unified text modality.

Motivation: 现有I2V生成方法因过早暴露高频细节导致视频动态性不足，ALG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ALG通过在去噪早期阶段自适应低通滤波调制输入图像频率内容。

Result: ALG在VBench-I2V测试中动态性平均提升36%，同时保持图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: ALG有效提升I2V生成的动态性，且不影响图像质量。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
producing high-quality, dynamic videos. To improve the visual controllability,
recent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support
image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses
motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared
to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and
identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in
the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory
that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this,
we propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model
sampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising
per-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency
content of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early
stage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly
improves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image
fidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG
achieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant
drop in video quality or image fidelity.

sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of
hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using
NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or
surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned
from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling
transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a
self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient
datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features
from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the
unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts
full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of
500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature
transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in
comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.

*Qilin Yin,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通用的上下文感知对比学习框架（UniCaCLF），用于解决多媒体取证领域中的时间伪造定位（TFL）问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多将深度伪造检测视为分类任务，忽略了视频部分片段被篡改的情况，而TFL在现实场景中更具挑战性和实用性。

Method: 采用监督对比学习，通过异常检测识别伪造片段，并提出上下文感知感知层和自适应上下文更新器，增强伪造与真实片段特征的区分性。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上的实验表明，UniCaCLF显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: UniCaCLF为时间伪造定位提供了一种高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Most research efforts in the multimedia forensics domain have focused on
detecting forgery audio-visual content and reached sound achievements. However,
these works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and
ignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal
forgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real
videos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application
scenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware
contrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages
supervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by
means of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal
forged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer
that utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context
updater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the
discriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine
instant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An
efficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the
limit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants
in a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence
to improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental
results over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLVTG提出了一种新框架，通过MambaAligner和LLMRefiner模块解决视频时序定位中的冗余注意力和多模态对齐问题，实现了更精准的定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法在视频时序定位中存在冗余注意力和多模态对齐不足的问题，需要改进。

Method: MLVTG结合MambaAligner（使用Vision Mamba块建模时序依赖）和LLMRefiner（利用预训练LLM的语义先验增强对齐），实现双对齐策略。

Result: 在QVHighlights、Charades-STA和TVSum数据集上，MLVTG表现优于现有基线，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MLVTG通过时序建模和语义净化，显著提升了视频时序定位的精度和性能。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips
corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging
task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer
from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key
modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba
blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and
extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner
leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM)
to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without
fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured
state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more
precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and
TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and
significantly outperforms existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多尺度特征学习和语义场景理解的框架，用于动态环境中的视觉定位，通过分层Transformer和跨尺度注意力提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中光照变化、恶劣天气和移动物体会破坏外观线索，现有绝对位姿回归方法难以保持一致。

Method: 采用分层Transformer和跨尺度注意力融合几何细节和上下文线索，结合语义监督训练网络学习视图不变特征。

Result: 在TartanAir数据集上，该方法在动态物体、光照变化和遮挡等挑战性场景中优于现有位姿回归方法。

Conclusion: 多尺度处理与语义指导的结合为动态环境中的鲁棒视觉定位提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Visual localization remains challenging in dynamic environments where
fluctuating lighting, adverse weather, and moving objects disrupt appearance
cues. Despite advances in feature representation, current absolute pose
regression methods struggle to maintain consistency under varying conditions.
To address this challenge, we propose a framework that synergistically combines
multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding. Our approach
employs a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention to fuse geometric
details and contextual cues, preserving spatial precision while adapting to
environmental changes. We improve the performance of this architecture with
semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding
the network to learn view-invariant features that encode persistent structural
information while suppressing complex environmental interference. Experiments
on TartanAir demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pose regression
methods in challenging scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes,
and occlusions. Our findings show that integrating multi-scale processing with
semantic guidance offers a promising strategy for robust visual localization in
real-world dynamic environments.

*Xijun Wang,Xin Li,Bingchen Li,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiftVSR是一种高效的视频超分辨率框架，通过动态时间注意力和注意力记忆缓存机制，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了长期一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频超分辨率中存在时间一致性不足和计算成本高的问题，尤其是长视频处理。

Method: 提出LiftVSR框架，结合动态时间注意力（DTA）和注意力记忆缓存（AMC），并采用非对称采样策略稳定推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出色，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: LiftVSR在高效性和性能上取得了平衡，为视频超分辨率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by
enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal
modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually
suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational
costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for
long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that
leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$,
achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To
balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal
modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary
components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal
modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii)
Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments
($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token
flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame
contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment
information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal
overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we
introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches
arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on
several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves
impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset上，TrajFlow在多项关键指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: TrajFlow为安全关键型自动驾驶应用提供了高效且准确的运动预测解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic
real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce
TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that
addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative
trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that
employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse
outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single
pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence
across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the
Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted
trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique
that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a
second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating
inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical
autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on
the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.

Result: SPP框架展示了深度网络如何沿主导谱方向逐步提炼线性表示，并在Vision-Language Models中表现出多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过理论和实证结合，推动了深度网络中表示形成的结构化理论，为提升AI的鲁棒性、公平性和透明度提供了新途径。

Abstract: High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI
transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or
circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable
concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose
the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned
directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with
increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP)
framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear
representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on
this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these
representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical
insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of
representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI
robustness, fairness, and transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨受试者EMG模式识别因个体差异（如肌肉解剖结构、电极放置和信号特征）而面临挑战，传统方法依赖特定受试者的校准数据，耗时且不实用。

Method: 采用端到端双分支对抗神经网络，将EMG特征解耦为模式特定和受试者特定成分，分别用于模式识别和个体识别。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在未见用户数据上表现稳健，优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究为无需校准的跨受试者EMG模式识别提供了新视角，并展示了模型在任务无关生物识别系统等更广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant
challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode
placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on
subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach
that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world
deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration
requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject
generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network
that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification
by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific
components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern
recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific
components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric
identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various
baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new
perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration
and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as
task-independent biometric systems.

Abstract: Recently, object detection models have witnessed notable performance
improvements, particularly with transformer-based models. However, new objects
frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually
learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental
Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing
models are still not practical due to their limited performance and prolonged
inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for IOD, called
Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both
efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for
imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.

Motivation: 现有VLN数据集缺乏细粒度的跨模态对齐标注（如子指令和实体级对齐），限制了智能体在导航任务中的准确决策能力。

Method: 提出FCA-NIG框架，通过子轨迹分割、地标检测、指令生成和实体选择等步骤，自动生成带有子指令-轨迹和实体-地标对齐标注的FCA-R2R数据集。

Result: 实验表明，FCA-R2R显著提升了多个VLN智能体的性能，增强了状态感知和决策准确性。

Conclusion: FCA-NIG无需人工标注即可生成高质量训练数据，推动了复杂导航任务中细粒度跨模态学习的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate
environments by integrating visual perception and natural language
instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of
fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily
focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting
sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate
navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose
FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation
instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this
framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories,
which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted
instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation,
and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs
with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to
form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the
FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise
sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the
performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop,
RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances
agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment
further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results
highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable
training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal
learning in complex navigation tasks.

Motivation: 大型Transformer模型的MLP模块占用大量参数，导致计算和内存成本高昂，因此需要一种高效压缩方法。

Method: 采用Gram-Schmidt权重剪枝策略，消除MLP隐藏层的冗余神经元，同时保留权重多样性以提升性能恢复能力。

Result: 实验表明，DGMR方法在多个先进视觉Transformer上实现了超过57%的参数和FLOPs减少，且性能几乎无损。

Conclusion: DGMR方法高效压缩大型视觉Transformer，显著降低资源需求，同时保持性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance
is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model
parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze
popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the
recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP
Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision
transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we
conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons
of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance
recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our
pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large
vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original
performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision
transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter
and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B),
our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without
performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at

Result: 实验表明ABSLD在鲁棒性和公平性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ABSLD是一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，可提升对抗性鲁棒公平性。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is widely recognized as an effective approach to
enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. As a variant of AT,
Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in
enhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust
fairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness
against some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial
robustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying
factors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for
different classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical
observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we
propose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge
Distillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness.
Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between
different classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness
degree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment
is managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes.
Additionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be
integrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate
ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of
robustness and fairness.

Motivation: 海洋垃圾在中等分辨率图像中因成分异质性难以可视化，而专家通常依赖经验和启发式方法选择波段。SAMSelect旨在通过自动化选择提高分类准确性和可视化效果。

Abstract: This work proposes SAMSelect, an algorithm to obtain a salient three-channel
visualization for multispectral images. We develop SAMSelect and show its use
for marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in
Sentinel-2 imagery. These debris are notoriously difficult to visualize due to
their compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery. Out of these
difficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains
a common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a
case-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect
selects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification
accuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its
central assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most
accurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for
photo-interpretation.
  We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine
debris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets
from the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously
unused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which
demonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices. We
describe the algorithm in this paper and provide an open-source code repository
that will be helpful for domain scientists doing visual photo interpretation,
especially in the marine field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法因可扩展性问题无法对所有输入数据进行训练，导致采样效率低下。本文旨在通过针对性采样和新型损失函数提升渲染和重建效果。

Method: 利用前景场景的隐式表面表示，建模3D图像投影空间的概率密度函数，实现更精准的射线采样；提出新的表面重建损失，结合近表面和空空间信息。

Result: 在现有神经隐式表面渲染器中集成新方法后，实现了更精确的3D重建和图像渲染，特别是在感兴趣区域表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文提出的采样策略和损失函数显著提升了NeRF的渲染和重建性能，为3D场景建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly
improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D
scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can
train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every
pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability
issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D
points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the
sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage
the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a
probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more
targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved
rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for
improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image
projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space
components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into
current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more
accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering,
especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CNN和Transformer在语义分割中表现优异，但全局上下文建模仍不足。Mamba在视觉任务中展现出长距离依赖建模潜力，因此结合CNN与Mamba以弥补各自弱点。

Method: 设计了增强双注意力块（EDAB）和多尺度注意力单元（MSAU），并引入Mamba增强的特征融合模块（FFM），以轻量化方式提升特征表示能力。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异，Cityscapes达到70.6% mIoU，CamVid达到73.6% mIoU，参数仅0.87M，计算量8.27G FLOPs。

Conclusion: ECMNet在准确性和效率上取得平衡，验证了CNN与Mamba结合的有效性。

Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers
have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs
with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context
modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision
tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper,
we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation,
dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based
framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a
Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to
improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale
Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial
aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion
Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented
accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that
the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6%
mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M
parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频合成和编辑的进步受限于高质量数据集的稀缺，尤其是在机器人学习中。RoboSwap旨在通过未配对数据解决机械臂替换问题，减少数据收集需求。

Method: RoboSwap结合GAN和扩散模型：GAN用于机械臂的未配对翻译，扩散模型用于增强视频的连贯性和运动真实性。

Result: 实验表明，RoboSwap在三个基准测试中优于现有视频和图像编辑模型，表现出更高的结构连贯性和运动一致性。

Conclusion: RoboSwap为机器人学习提供了可靠的跨平台数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis
and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues
to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform
generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic
arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike
previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same
environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired
data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap
introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion
models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic
arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one
robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video
background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion
realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained
independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms
state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of
both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust
solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

Conclusion: 通过三项关键贡献，本文方法在速度和精度上均优于现有技术，为点云表面重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for
unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning
methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that
allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized
representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but
lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation
for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum
resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the
state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key
contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to
classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed
up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to
use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel
multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise
levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can
provide improved reconstruction results.

Conclusion: 方向对齐的3D生成显著提升了模型性能，为下游任务提供了新可能。

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive object shape and orientation from a single image,
guided by strong priors about canonical poses. However, existing 3D generative
models often produce misaligned results due to inconsistent training data,
limiting their usability in downstream tasks. To address this gap, we introduce
the task of orientation-aligned 3D object generation: producing 3D objects from
single images with consistent orientations across categories. To facilitate
this, we construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 orientation-aligned 3D
models spanning 1,008 categories. Leveraging Objaverse-OA, we fine-tune two
representative 3D generative models based on multi-view diffusion and 3D
variational autoencoder frameworks to produce aligned objects that generalize
well to unseen objects across various categories. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our method over post-hoc alignment approaches.
Furthermore, we showcase downstream applications enabled by our aligned object
generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation via
analysis-by-synthesis and efficient arrow-based object rotation manipulation.

Motivation: 现有模型在预测视频记忆性时未能充分利用运动线索，且运动特征表示在微调阶段因缺乏标注数据而受损。

Result: TMCCL在两个视频记忆性预测数据集上达到最优性能；MWCVS在两个视频摘要数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TMCCL和MWCVS展示了视频记忆性预测的潜力，为多模态学习和视频摘要提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video memorability refers to the ability of videos to be recalled after
viewing, playing a crucial role in creating content that remains memorable.
Existing models typically focus on extracting multimodal features to predict
video memorability scores but often fail to fully utilize motion cues. The
representation of motion features is compromised during the fine-tuning phase
of the motion feature extractor due to a lack of labeled data. In this paper,
we introduce the Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss (TMCCL), a multimodal
video memorability prediction model designed to enhance the representation of
motion features. We tackle the challenge of improving motion feature
representation by leveraging text description similarities across videos to
establish positive and negative motion sample sets for a given target. This
enhancement allows the model to learn similar feature representations for
semantically related motion content, resulting in more accurate memorability
predictions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video
memorability prediction datasets. Moreover, the potential applications of video
memorability prediction have been underexplored. To address this gap, we
present Memorability Weighted Correction for Video Summarization (MWCVS), using
video memorability prediction to reduce subjectivity in video summarization
labels. Experimental results on two video summarization datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of MWCVS, showcasing the promising applications of video
memorability prediction.

Motivation: 多相机系统中由于传感器和光学器件的差异，实现颜色一致性是一个挑战，现有方法在适应性、计算成本或实际需求上存在不足。

Method: 提出了神经物理模型（NPM），通过模拟特定光照下的原始图像来估计设备间的转换，支持物理测量初始化，并可在有无配对数据的情况下训练。

Result: 在NUS和BeyondRGB等公开数据集上，NPM表现优于现有方法，实现了跨传感器和光学系统的稳健颜色一致性。

Conclusion: NPM是一种高效、适应性强的解决方案，能够显著提升多相机系统的颜色一致性表现。

Abstract: Achieving consistent color reproduction across multiple cameras is essential
for seamless image fusion and Image Processing Pipeline (ISP) compatibility in
modern devices, but it is a challenging task due to variations in sensors and
optics. Existing raw-to-raw conversion methods face limitations such as poor
adaptability to changing illumination, high computational costs, or impractical
requirements such as simultaneous camera operation and overlapping
fields-of-view. We introduce the Neural Physical Model (NPM), a lightweight,
physically-informed approach that simulates raw images under specified
illumination to estimate transformations between devices. The NPM effectively
adapts to varying illumination conditions, can be initialized with physical
measurements, and supports training with or without paired data. Experiments on
public datasets like NUS and BeyondRGB demonstrate that NPM outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods, providing robust chromatic consistency across
different sensors and optical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务学习中任务平衡和扩展成本的挑战，同时防止基础模型因过拟合特定指令而退化。

Method: 在LLaVA-1.5基础上引入频谱感知巩固和无监督查询正则化，改进任务平衡并防止基础模型退化。

Conclusion: LLaVA-c方法有效解决了多任务学习的挑战，同时保持了模型的通用能力，为持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual
understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling
strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask
learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment
of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic
forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising
alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing
capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance,
neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions,
which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but
effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware
consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization
to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific
performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments
demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance
and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that
task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass
multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.

Result: 在开放词汇目标检测和语义分割任务中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: ATAS验证了同时保持语义一致性和细粒度对齐对密集预测任务的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary
dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual
concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level
understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We
identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic
coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation
methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic
coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To
overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel
approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained
alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation
levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal
self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders,
preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail
recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation
benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline
CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and
underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and
fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习模型在高分辨率和大陆尺度野火预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent
history, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting
large quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a
climate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season
that affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower
wildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions.
Wildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the
likelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future
wildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data
has enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models,
aiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and
temporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on
coarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to
wildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\sim
0.1${\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and
baseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada,
leveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite
images (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and
environmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two
major deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal
inputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a
peak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season
never seen during model training. This demonstrates the potential of
multi-modal deep learning models for wildfire forecasting at high-resolution
and continental scale.

VReST meticulously traverses the reasoning landscape by establishing a search

mechanism assesses the quality of reasoning steps by integrating the utility of
sub-questions, answer correctness, and the relevance of vision-language clues,
all without the need for additional models. VReST surpasses current prompting

of test-time scaling laws in multimodal tasks, offering a promising direction

Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel-
and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging
due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they
rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions,
and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We
propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense
point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By
leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion
trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based
optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster
assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views
despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory
signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames,
improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By
initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for
training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video
datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly
available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main

Conclusion: TraGraph-GS显著提升了大规模场景的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a
challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition
large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using
Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view
rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not
generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques
struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions
results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these
challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable
high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a
spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which
incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures
and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate
artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its
superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight
its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86
dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to
state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient
encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding
language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene
understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three
main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene
optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are
evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close
to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D
understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark
that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D
space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor
dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable
paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast
feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation
performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS
dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from
multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could
harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made
public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.

*Dieuwertje Alblas,Patryk Rygiel,Julian Suk,Kaj O. Kappe,Marieke Hofman,Christoph Brune,Kak Khee Yeung,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于SE(3)-对称变换器模型的方法，用于预测腹主动脉瘤（AAA）的生长，通过保留血管表面的解剖结构和几何保真度，实现个性化监测策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于AAA最大直径的监测策略未考虑3D形状与生长的复杂关系，可能导致标准化监测间隔不适用。个性化生长预测可优化监测。

Method: 使用SE(3)-对称变换器模型，直接在血管模型表面预测AAA生长，结合局部多物理特征。训练数据为24名患者的113次CTA扫描。

Result: 模型预测AAA生长的中位直径误差为1.18 mm，并能以0.93的准确率识别患者是否在两年内需手术修复。外部验证集表现良好。

Conclusion: 基于血管表面的局部定向AAA生长预测可行，有助于个性化监测策略。

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the
abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current
clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA
diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet
these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on
the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the
complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized
intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve
monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model
to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with
local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have
parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular
surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using
a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24
AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model
predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of
1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a
patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).
Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set
consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our
results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular
surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

*Yuhang Wang,Jun Li,Zhijian Wu,Jianhua Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InceptionMamba是一种新型的卷积神经网络架构，通过正交带卷积和Mamba模块解决了InceptionNeXt在空间依赖性和全局上下文建模上的不足，实现了更高的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InceptionNeXt在图像分类和下游任务中表现优异，但其一维条带卷积限制了空间依赖性的捕捉和局部邻域的空间建模能力，且卷积操作的局部性约束不利于全局上下文建模。

Method: 提出InceptionMamba架构，用正交带卷积替代传统一维条带卷积以实现空间建模，并通过瓶颈Mamba模块实现全局上下文建模。

Result: 在分类和多个下游任务中，InceptionMamba表现出最先进的性能，同时具有优越的参数和计算效率。

Conclusion: InceptionMamba通过改进的空间建模和全局上下文建模，显著提升了性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown
excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream
tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it
suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different
dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood.
Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are
detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in
this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip
convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba
to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling
can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced
cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive
evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the
proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior
parameter and computational efficiency. The source code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出RS-MTDF框架，利用预训练的视觉基础模型（VFMs）作为多教师，通过特征级蒸馏提升半监督遥感图像语义分割性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割依赖大量标注数据，成本高且耗时。半监督方法虽能缓解数据依赖，但现有方法因标记与未标记数据分布不匹配导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出RS-MTDF框架，利用冻结的VFMs（如DINOv2和CLIP）作为多教师，通过特征级蒸馏对齐学生模型特征，并将知识融合到解码器中。

Result: 在ISPRS Potsdam、LoveDA和DeepGlobe数据集上表现优异，尤其在LoveDA上不同标注比例下均优于现有方法，多数语义类别IoU最高。

Conclusion: 多教师VFM指导能显著提升遥感分割的泛化能力和语义理解，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various
applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale,
high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and
time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a
promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS
methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited
labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization.
We propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and
diverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can
effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for
SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and
Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge
embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing.
Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and
CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student
features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative
power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.
Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS
Potsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing
approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in
the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of
multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and
semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of each proposed module.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的自监督学习框架Gaussian2Scene，用于点云预训练，解决了现有方法依赖隐式场景表示和高内存需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在场景级别依赖RGB-D图像重建，但受限于隐式表示和高内存需求，且难以捕捉3D几何结构。

Method: 采用3DGS进行预训练，分两阶段：第一阶段通过双分支掩码自编码器学习2D和3D场景表示；第二阶段利用重建点云和高斯基元的几何位置进行监督学习。

Result: 在多个下游3D目标检测任务中表现优于现有预训练方法。

Conclusion: Gaussian2Scene通过显式3D表示和两阶段训练策略，提升了几何理解和跨模态学习效果。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a
cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from
large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often
incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D
images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This
strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model
to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches
are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory
demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in
2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL
framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the
computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct
3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the
backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training
strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D
and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with
reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric
locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process
reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection
tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.

Conclusion: Landsat-Bench为Landsat数据提供了标准化评估工具，并证明SSL4EO-L预训练的GFM在遥感任务中表现更优。

Abstract: The Landsat program offers over 50 years of globally consistent Earth
imagery. However, the lack of benchmarks for this data constrains progress
towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we
introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that
adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and
LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both
common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L
dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract
better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet,
including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and
BigEarthNet-L.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升多种现有异常检测方法的性能。

Conclusion: HomographyAD是一种适用于实际工业数据集的有效异常检测方法。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a task that distinguishes normal and abnormal data,
which is important for applying automation technologies of the manufacturing
facilities. For MVTec dataset that is a representative AD dataset for
industrial environment, many recent works have shown remarkable performances.
However, the existing anomaly detection works have a limitation of showing good
performance for fully-aligned datasets only, unlike real-world industrial
environments. To solve this limitation, we propose HomographyAD, a novel deep
anomaly detection methodology based on the ImageNet-pretrained network, which
is specially designed for actual industrial dataset. Specifically, we first
suggest input foreground alignment using the deep homography estimation method.
In addition, we fine-tune the model by self homography learning to learn
additional shape information from normal samples. Finally, we conduct anomaly
detection based on the measure of how far the feature of test sample is from
the distribution of the extracted normal features. By applying our proposed
method to various existing AD approaches, we show performance enhancement
through extensive experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去雾方法在处理复杂场景时效果有限，因此需要一种更有效的框架来提升去雾性能。

Method: 提出了一种改进的PDE模型，结合非局部正则化和暗通道先验，利用Lax-Milgram定理证明了弱解的存在唯一性，并通过PyTorch GPU加速实现了高效的固定点迭代方案。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在去雾任务中表现优异，且可推广至深度学习模型范式。

Conclusion: 该PDE框架为单图像去雾提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for
single-image dehazing. By integrating the atmospheric scattering model with
nonlocal regularization and dark channel prior, we propose the improved PDE: \[
-\text{div}\left(D(\nabla u)\nabla u\right) + \lambda(t) G(u) = \Phi(I,t,A) \]
where $D(\nabla u) = (|\nabla u| + \epsilon)^{-1}$ is the edge-preserving
diffusion coefficient, $G(u)$ is the Gaussian convolution operator, and
$\lambda(t)$ is the adaptive regularization parameter based on transmission map
$t$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $H_0^1(\Omega)$
using Lax-Milgram theorem, and implement an efficient fixed-point iteration
scheme accelerated by PyTorch GPU computation. The experimental results
demonstrate that this method is a promising deghazing solution that can be
generalized to the deep model paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统rectified flow虽然高效，但直线路径限制了采样空间多样性，且难以处理多尺度噪声。

Method: 提出Discretized-RF，将路径离散化为动量场子路径，并在速度上引入噪声以改进多样性和噪声建模。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成高质量且多样化的结果，路径更高效。

Conclusion: Discretized-RF通过动量场设计，显著提升了rectified flow的性能。

Abstract: Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art
among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in
straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a
series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line
connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast,
and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns,
which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling
space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow
only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two
distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present
Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow
models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random
velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path
into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'')
to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution
$p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly
superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the
sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and
multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several
representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by
sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse
and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

Result: 在弱监督下实现了交互自然性和泛化性的最先进性能，支持文本条件生成和交互式物体操作。

Conclusion: HunyuanVideo-HOMA展示了在HOI视频生成中的多功能性和高效性，并通过用户友好的演示界面支持实际应用。

Abstract: To address key limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation
-- specifically the reliance on curated motion data, limited generalization to
novel objects/scenarios, and restricted accessibility -- we introduce
HunyuanVideo-HOMA, a weakly conditioned multimodal-driven framework.
HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise
inputs through sparse, decoupled motion guidance. It encodes appearance and
motion signals into the dual input space of a multimodal diffusion transformer
(MMDiT), fusing them within a shared context space to synthesize temporally
consistent and physically plausible interactions. To optimize training, we
integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT
weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a
facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip
synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in
interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision. Finally,
HunyuanVideo-HOMA demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and
interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly demo interface.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率正弦图修复对CT重建至关重要，但现有扩散模型因内存和计算需求过高而受限。

Method: HiSin采用分辨率引导的渐进推理，先在低分辨率提取全局结构，再在高分辨率处理小补丁，并结合频率感知补丁跳过和结构自适应步长分配。

Result: 实验显示HiSin峰值内存使用减少31.25%，推理时间减少18.15%，且修复精度稳定。

Conclusion: HiSin在高效性和准确性上均表现优异，适用于不同数据集、分辨率和掩码条件。

Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography
reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible
artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task
due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their
application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and
computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel
diffusion based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting via
resolution-guided progressive inference. It progressively extracts global
structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small
patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. It further incorporates
frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce
redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory
usage by up to 31.25% and inference time by up to 18.15%, and maintains
inpainting accuracy across datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.

Motivation: 随着T2I模型在视觉内容生成中的普及，其是否能准确反映多元文化背景引发了担忧。

Method: 研究引入CulturalFrames基准，涵盖10个国家、5个社会文化领域的983个提示和3637张图像，结合10k+人类标注进行系统评估。

Result: T2I模型在显性（68%）和隐性（49%）文化期望上表现不佳，现有评估指标与人类判断相关性低。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了T2I模型在文化表现上的重大缺陷，为开发更具文化敏感性的模型和评估方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual
content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent
diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to
systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with
respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this
end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human
evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10
countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts,
3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over
10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet
the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging
explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are
missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit
expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while
implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human
judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning.
Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable
directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation
methodologies.

Abstract: Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining
superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It
employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the
internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of
interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and
often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals.
Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer
vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image
analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences
between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome
these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language
foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for
vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text
refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our
approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two
tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our
method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation
models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing
state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models. The source code of

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels
at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis
and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into
resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high
cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain
challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based
deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from
whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets
demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes,
highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26%
respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene
correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our
method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker
expression.

*Zike Wu,Qi Yan,Xuanyu Yi,Lele Wang,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamSplat是一个实时框架，将未校准视频流转换为动态3D高斯泼溅表示，解决了实时处理、动态场景建模和长期稳定性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时处理未校准输入、动态场景建模和长期稳定性，StreamSplat旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出静态编码器中的概率采样机制和动态解码器中的双向变形场，实现高效动态建模。

Result: 在静态和动态基准测试中，StreamSplat在重建质量和动态场景建模上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StreamSplat支持任意长度视频流的在线重建，性能优越。

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams
is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods
struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated
inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3)
maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we
introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms
uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering
scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical
innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS
position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic
decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive
experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat
consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic
scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily
long video streams. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出DiscoVLA方法，通过同时减少视觉、语言和对齐三方面的差异，提升视频-文本检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注视觉差异，忽视了语言和对齐差异，导致从图像级到视频级的迁移效果不佳。

Method: 引入图像-视频特征融合解决视觉和语言差异，生成伪图像标题学习细粒度对齐，并提出图像-视频对齐蒸馏增强视频级对齐。

Result: 在MSRVTT数据集上，DiscoVLA以CLIP（ViT-B/16）为基础，R@1达到50.5%，优于之前方法1.5%。

Conclusion: DiscoVLA通过全面解决三方面差异，显著提升了视频-文本检索性能。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pretraining model CLIP
for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused
on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands
comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge
in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and
alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting
language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in
Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all
three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to
integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both
vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image
captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment
discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which
leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In
particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous
methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1. The code is

Conclusion: 该框架为异构模型的知识组合提供了一种有效的训练无关方法，显著提升了生成任务的性能与用户体验。

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge
over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse
knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual
language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics
engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product
of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition
from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product
distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our
framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding
better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing
flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

TL;DR: WetCat是首个专为自动化技能评估设计的湿实验室白内障手术视频数据集，旨在解决传统手动评估的低效和主观性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统湿实验室手术培训依赖手动评估，效率低且主观性强，计算机视觉技术为自动化评估提供了可能。

Method: 构建WetCat数据集，包含高分辨率视频、阶段注释和关键解剖结构语义分割，专注于囊膜撕开和超声乳化阶段。

Result: WetCat为开发可解释的AI评估工具奠定了基础，支持标准化临床指标的自动化技能评估。

Conclusion: WetCat推动了客观、可扩展的手术教育，并为眼科培训中的自动化工作流程分析设定了新标准。

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab
environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in
ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual
performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often
subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising
avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and
objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic
surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or
isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in
controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat,
the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for
automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of
surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive
phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures.
These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment
during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to
standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these
essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven
evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a
strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets
a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in
ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in
Synapse https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn66401174/files.

Result: MIRAGE在分类和分割任务中优于通用和专业基础模型及分割方法。

Conclusion: MIRAGE适合作为开发稳健眼科AI系统的基础，模型和评估基准已开源。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting
clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography
(OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and
existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation
models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown
promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for
ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and
focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel
multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO)
images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO
classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and
specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in
both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the
development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE
and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双曲特征增强方法局限于封闭环境，仅针对已知类别生成特征，无法适应开放环境的需求。

Method: 1. 使用神经ODE模块结合元学习估计特征分布；2. 引入正则化器保持双曲空间中的层次结构；3. 推导双曲双增强损失的上界。

Result: 在五个开放环境任务中显著提升了双曲算法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为开放环境中的双曲特征增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Feature augmentation generates novel samples in the feature space, providing
an effective way to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms
with hyperbolic geometry. Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to
closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen
classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we
propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment,
which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic
space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for
efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation
module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both
seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the
latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also
derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to
train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen
classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks:
class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning,
zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our
method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in
open-environment.

Motivation: 研究发现VAR模型的高频组件或后期步骤导致推理延迟，但计算冗余尚未深入分析。

Method: 提出自动跳过步骤策略和替换无条件分支技术，并基于样本频率信息动态选择加速策略。

Result: SkipVAR在GenEval基准测试中实现1.81倍加速和2.62倍速度提升，平均SSIM超过0.88。

Conclusion: 频率感知的自适应加速策略有效提升自回归图像生成的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that
high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute
disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational
redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In
this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and
identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional
branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic
step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to
improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the
information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.
Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a
technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.
Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies
significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,
a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically
select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate
the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark
datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments
show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall
acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model
quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware,
training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and
has been publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于注意力的方法，通过学习的二进制注意力掩码确保只有关注的图像区域影响预测，解决背景干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 背景可能强烈影响物体感知，导致偏差表示，尤其是在物体出现在分布外背景时。同时，许多图像级任务需要识别相关区域，通常需要上下文。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段处理完整图像以发现物体部分和任务相关区域；第二阶段利用输入注意力掩码限制其感受野到这些区域，过滤虚假信息。两阶段联合训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提高了对虚假相关性和分布外背景的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过注意力掩码和两阶段框架有效解决了背景干扰问题，提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention
masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction.
Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased
representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution
backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require
identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this
conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image
to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2
leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these
regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious
information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage
1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and
out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现一致提升，MMMU-PRO上总体提升2%，其中文科领域显著提升9%。

Conclusion: 结论表明，将推理视为搜索过程可以有效连接碎片化知识，为非推理模型生成长推理链提供了可行方法。

Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the
possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought
reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via
distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning
models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply
abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden
knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training
or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer
pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a
search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader
inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented
knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We
evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent
improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on
MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive
tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k
graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91\% human acceptance
rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it can more efficiently
guide agents compared to manually annotated data. We conduct multidimensional

performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future
advancements. Our project is available at https://omni-bench.github.io/.

Motivation: 在信息爆炸时代，如何高效利用大规模无标注数据并减少对高质量标注的依赖是医学图像分析的关键挑战。半监督学习（SSL）通过知识转移提升无标注数据利用率，成为重要研究方向。

Abstract: In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level
annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by
facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of
fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction
in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models
(e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised
SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction
capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus
effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image
segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong"
consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative
Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature
discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across
multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across
multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the
features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a
prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a
Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data,
fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical
image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably,
SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice. Code will be available at

Conclusion: 本文展示了ViT模型在跨光谱人体识别中的潜力，并强调了遮挡问题的重要性，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a
wide range of biometric tasks, including face and body recognition. In this
work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the
challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching
images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT
architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond
traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side
Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and
camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our
results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly
incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in
visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in
visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because
existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly
feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the
impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain
Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared
images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral
evaluations.

Result: 实验表明，SEE在多个ISCOS任务中达到最先进性能，并可作为即插即用方案提升现有模型。

Conclusion: SEE通过统一框架和策略有效解决了ISCOS的挑战，具有广泛适用性和高性能。

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves
segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments,
utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for
model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited
supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the
difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which
arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To
tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher
framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment
Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced
by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality
segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label
generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce
informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select
the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring
robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic
similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups
features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering
similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating
more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.
We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing
the performance of existing models.

performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for
small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting
small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer
vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an
optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed
method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome
degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance
improvement on the DOTA dataset.

TL;DR: ORIDa是一个大规模的真实世界图像合成数据集，包含30,000多张图像和200个独特对象，支持多样化的场景和位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏多样性和规模，无法全面探索真实世界场景。

Method: ORIDa包含事实-反事实集和仅事实场景，前者展示对象在不同位置，后者扩展环境多样性。

Result: ORIDa是首个公开的大规模复杂数据集，为对象合成研究提供了重要资源。

Conclusion: ORIDa推动了对象合成研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Object compositing, the task of placing and harmonizing objects in images of
diverse visual scenes, has become an important task in computer vision with the
rise of generative models. However, existing datasets lack the diversity and
scale required to comprehensively explore real-world scenarios. We introduce
ORIDa (Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset), a large-scale,
real-captured dataset containing over 30,000 images featuring 200 unique
objects, each of which is presented across varied positions and scenes. ORIDa
has two types of data: factual-counterfactual sets and factual-only scenes. The
factual-counterfactual sets consist of four factual images showing an object in
different positions within a scene and a single counterfactual (or background)
image of the scene without the object, resulting in five images per scene. The
factual-only scenes include a single image containing an object in a specific
context, expanding the variety of environments. To our knowledge, ORIDa is the
first publicly available dataset with its scale and complexity for real-world
image composition. Extensive analysis and experiments highlight the value of
ORIDa as a resource for advancing further research in object compositing.

*Amirreza Rouhi,Solmaz Arezoomandan,Knut Peterson,Joseph T. Woods,David K. Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADAM是一种无需训练的自优化框架，通过结合语言模型和视觉嵌入，实现开放世界中未知物体的自主标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统目标检测模型依赖预定义类别、无法识别开放世界中新物体的问题。

Method: 利用LLM生成候选标签，结合CLIP视觉嵌入构建ELR，通过频率投票和跨模态重排序分配标签，并通过自优化循环提升一致性。

Result: 在COCO和PASCAL数据集上，ADAM无需微调即可有效标注新类别。

Conclusion: ADAM为开放世界物体标注提供了一种无需训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting
their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome
this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model,
a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown
objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene.
These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an
Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category
supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually
similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and
cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance
consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository
labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority
re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate
that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and
contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级模块化框架，通过改进标准范围视图网络的初始块，分别处理几何属性和反射强度，以增强LiDAR分割在恶劣天气下的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 范围视图方法在LiDAR分割中因高效计算和实时部署兼容性而流行，但其在恶劣天气下的泛化性能尚未充分研究，限制了实际应用可靠性。

Method: 提出模块化框架，将初始块分为两个分支处理几何属性和反射强度，引入GAS模块抑制天气引起的空间噪声，RDC模块通过记忆引导自适应实例归一化校正反射失真。

Result: 在不同基准和基线模型上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了恶劣天气下的泛化性能，且推理开销极小。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际LiDAR分割提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR segmentation has emerged as an important task to enrich multimedia
experiences and analysis. Range-view-based methods have gained popularity due
to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time
deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather
conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world
environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that
affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather.
To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework
that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing
models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view
networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance
intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS)
module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a
Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance
distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The
processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation
pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse
weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective
solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation.

TL;DR: ALTA提出了一种高效的医学视觉-语言对齐方法，通过适应预训练的视觉模型，显著提升了检索和零样本分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的跨模态对比学习方法在视觉表示能力上表现不佳，而多模态掩码建模方法虽视觉表示强但跨模态匹配能力弱。ALTA旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: ALTA通过适应预训练的视觉模型（仅需约8%的可训练参数和少于1/5的计算消耗），并结合时间多视图放射影像输入，提升视觉-语言对齐效果。

Result: ALTA在文本到图像和图像到文本检索任务中分别比最佳对比方法高出4%和6%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: ALTA不仅高效，还提升了视觉和语言理解能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning
shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and
zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive
learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation
capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language
alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked
modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual
representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through
Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes
only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the
computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves
superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and
zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked
record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph
inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their
corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language
alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the
best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image
accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval
accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment
also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly

TL;DR: 本文探讨了生成模型（尤其是扩散式文本到图像模型）在避免生成不良内容时的挑战，指出现有概念替换技术（CRTs）在图像到图像（I2I）场景中的不足，并提出了一种新方法AntiMirror以提高效果和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在避免生成不良内容（如冒犯性、版权或名人形象）时面临挑战，现有CRTs在I2I场景中效果不佳，需要改进。

Method: 通过I2I模型实证现有CRTs的不足，提出新方法AntiMirror，利用目标图像编辑技术实现效果和保真度。

Result: 现有CRTs在I2I场景中无效，AntiMirror方法在替换不良内容时能保持输入的其他概念。

Conclusion: 需要针对I2I场景改进CRTs，AntiMirror方法展示了可行性，强调了保真度的重要性。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models,
have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid
generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted
content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept
replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to
"erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have
started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt
as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are
known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model
to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact
erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in
emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted
concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy
between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing
unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs
to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected
fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of
targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity.
We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精地图维护成本高，而在线构建方法受限于车载传感器的短感知范围，SD地图作为先验信息可解决这一问题。

Method: SDTagNet结合SD地图的折线数据和文本注释，并引入点级编码器和正交元素标识符，统一整合各类地图元素。

Result: 在Argoverse 2和nuScenes数据集上，性能提升高达5.9 mAP（45%），优于无先验和已有SD先验方法。

Conclusion: SDTagNet通过充分利用SD地图的语义信息，显著提升了在线高精地图构建的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information
to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but
their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.
This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which
generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are
inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To
overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches
have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are
significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map
construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD
maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach
introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we
incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but
additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this
way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the
dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,
we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element
identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on
Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up
to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP
(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors. Code is

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了多实例学习（MIL）模型在计算病理学中的迁移学习能力，发现预训练模型在不同器官和任务上表现优于从头训练的模型，并提供了标准化资源和预训练权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中，MIL模型在弱监督和小数据集上表现不佳，而迁移学习的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 评估了11个预训练MIL模型在21个任务上的表现，包括形态学和分子亚型预测。

Result: 预训练MIL模型在不同器官和目标任务上表现更优，泛化能力强，且数据需求更少。

Conclusion: MIL模型具有强大的适应能力，迁移学习可显著提升计算病理学性能，研究还提供了标准化资源。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational
pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings
from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly
supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and
conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address
data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of
pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for
morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that
pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target
task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover,
pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs
and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less
pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL
models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost
performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the
implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on
popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DIsoN的去中心化OOD检测框架，解决了训练数据无法共享时的OOD检测问题，并在医疗影像数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域（如医疗影像）部署ML模型时，需要检测训练数据中未见的输入（OOD），但现有方法要么丢弃训练数据，要么假设训练和测试数据集中存储，这在现实中难以实现。

Method: 提出了Isolation Network框架，通过解决二分类任务量化测试样本与训练数据的分离难度；进一步提出DIsoN，通过交换模型参数实现无法共享数据时的比较，并扩展了类条件化的版本。

Result: 在四个医疗影像数据集上的12个OOD检测任务中，DIsoN表现优于现有方法，同时保护了数据隐私。

Conclusion: DIsoN为ML开发者提供了一种新的服务模式，即在不共享数据的情况下，远程安全地利用训练数据进行OOD检测。

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains
such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen
during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent
unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit
from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test
samples and the training data distribution to identify differences.
State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data
after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally
stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This
is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible
due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy
constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework
that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the
training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose
Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of
training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only
model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and
deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target
sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on
four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,
histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against
existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD
detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers
could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of
their training data for OOD detection services. Code will be available upon

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Dispersive Loss的简单插件式正则化器，用于改进扩散生成模型，无需额外数据或预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型通常缺乏显式正则化，且与表示学习进展脱节。本文旨在通过Dispersive Loss弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出Dispersive Loss，一种鼓励隐空间表示分散的损失函数，无需正样本对，不影响回归采样过程。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上评估，Dispersive Loss在多种模型中均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Dispersive Loss为生成模型与表示学习的结合提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has
largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These
diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally
lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive
Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves
diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal
representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive
self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive
sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used
for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment
(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no
pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate
Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report
consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work
will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation
learning.

diversity in current SLAM benchmarks by introducing a novel ground truth
collection framework that leverages calibration boards and a 360-camera. We
collect indoor, outdoor, and object scanning videos with synchronized monocular
and stereo RGB video outputs as well as IMU. We further propose a new scene
scale-aware evaluation metric for SLAM based on the the optical flow induced by
the camera pose estimation error. In contrast to the current metrics, our new
metric allows for comparison between the performance of SLAM methods across
scenes as opposed to existing metrics such as Average Trajectory Error (ATE),
allowing researchers to analyze the failure modes of their methods. We also
propose a challenging Novel View Synthesis benchmark that covers cases not
covered by current NVS benchmarks, such as fully non-Lambertian scenes with

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ASVR的方法，通过自回归语义视觉重建，联合学习视觉和文本模态，显著提升了多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）仅对文本序列进行自回归监督，未充分利用视觉模态，导致无法处理无标注图像、遗漏关键视觉细节及难以表达视觉内容等问题。

Method: 引入ASVR方法，在统一的自回归框架中联合学习视觉和文本模态，通过自回归重建图像的语义表示而非原始外观。

Result: ASVR在多种数据规模和LLM骨干上均表现优异，如在LLaVA-1.5上平均提升了5%的多模态基准分数。

Conclusion: 自回归语义视觉重建能稳定提升多模态理解能力，尤其在处理离散语义标记时效果显著。

Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision
solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality
into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an
inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that
captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain
vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,
current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially
overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have
explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive
visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),
which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified
autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw
visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal
understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic
representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find
that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can
effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and
consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding
benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying
data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves
LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is
available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.

Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI
systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is
especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role
in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline
that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such
as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is
Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation
model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity,
multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We
showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale
the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and
challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data
helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization
in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving
policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights
through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型加速技术依赖统一启发式方法或时间嵌入变体，容易导致输出不一致且需要大量校准。

Method: 发现统一幅度定律，提出Magnitude-aware Cache（MagCache），通过误差建模和自适应缓存策略跳过不重要时间步。

Result: MagCache在Open-Sora和Wan 2.1上分别实现2.1倍和2.68倍加速，视觉质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MagCache是一种高效且鲁棒的加速方法，仅需单样本校准，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on
uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse
cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with
curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific
overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a
unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts.
Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases
monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several
steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache)
that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism
and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of
curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for
calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x
speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior
visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM,
and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMM在推理中存在模态不平衡问题，语言先验偏见过强，影响泛化能力并导致幻觉。现有偏好优化方法未有效抑制LLM内部偏见，且依赖离线数据。

Method: MBPO通过对抗性扰动生成硬负样本构建离线偏好数据集，并利用闭端任务生成在线验证奖励数据，结合GRPO进行训练。

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been
significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent
preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality
imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual
inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes
hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs
do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model
(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on
offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to
dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified
rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM
alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,
Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality
imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset
by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due
to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of
input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended
tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed
to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging
vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

TL;DR: Bingo是一种RL框架，通过改进长度奖励设计，提升语言模型推理效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提升语言模型推理能力时，多关注准确性而忽视效率，且直接长度奖励常导致准确性下降。

Method: Bingo引入显著性感知长度奖励和动态长度奖励，逐步减少无关标记并动态调整推理长度。

Result: 实验表明，Bingo在多个基准测试中优于其他方法，实现了准确性与效率的平衡。

Conclusion: Bingo证明了显式训练语言模型以实现高效推理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities,
yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or
redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy,
with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches
introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often
leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL
framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient
reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length
reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,
and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for
hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and
efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based
reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly
for efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 解决科学发现中AI训练和评估数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 利用LLM的编码能力和参数知识，自动搜索、筛选和合成任务及代码解决方案，构建AutoSDT-5K数据集。

Result: AutoSDT-5K数据集包含5,404个任务，专家验证显示93%任务有效，92.2%代码正确。训练的AutoSDT-Coder模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，接近GPT-4o水平。

Conclusion: AutoSDT为科学发现提供了高质量数据，显著提升了AI模型的性能。

Abstract: Despite long-standing efforts in accelerating scientific discovery with AI,
building AI co-scientists remains challenging due to limited high-quality data
for training and evaluation. To tackle this data scarcity issue, we present
AutoSDT, an automatic pipeline that collects high-quality coding tasks in
real-world data-driven discovery workflows. AutoSDT leverages the coding
capabilities and parametric knowledge of LLMs to search for diverse sources,
select ecologically valid tasks, and synthesize accurate task instructions and
code solutions. Using our pipeline, we construct AutoSDT-5K, a dataset of 5,404
coding tasks for data-driven discovery that covers four scientific disciplines
and 756 unique Python packages. To the best of our knowledge, AutoSDT-5K is the
only automatically collected and the largest open dataset for data-driven
scientific discovery. Expert feedback on a subset of 256 tasks shows the
effectiveness of AutoSDT: 93% of the collected tasks are ecologically valid,
and 92.2% of the synthesized programs are functionally correct. Trained on
AutoSDT-5K, the Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct LLM series, dubbed AutoSDT-Coder, show
substantial improvement on two challenging data-driven discovery benchmarks,
ScienceAgentBench and DiscoveryBench. Most notably, AutoSDT-Coder-32B reaches
the same level of performance as GPT-4o on ScienceAgentBench with a success
rate of 7.8%, doubling the performance of its base model. On DiscoveryBench, it
lifts the hypothesis matching score to 8.1, bringing a 17.4% relative
improvement and closing the gap between open-weight models and GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在安全性和有用性之间存在权衡，可能导致敏感领域的不当响应，因此需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: HC-RLHF将人类偏好分解为有用性和安全性，分别训练奖励模型和成本模型，并通过两步优化和安全测试确保安全性。

Result: 实验表明，HC-RLHF能以高概率生成安全模型，并在无害性和有用性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HC-RLHF提供了一种理论保证的安全对齐方法，适用于敏感领域的语言模型。

Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a
tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in
sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose
High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a
method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing
helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human
preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by
training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a
two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the
reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost
constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to
verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the
actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including
proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater
than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF
to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and
LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF
produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and
helpfulness compared to previous methods.

TL;DR: ECON是一种高效的多LLM协调框架，通过贝叶斯纳什均衡减少计算成本并提升性能。


<details>

Motivation: 解决多智能体框架中计算成本高和缺乏收敛保证的问题。

Method: 将多LLM协调建模为不完全信息博弈，采用分层强化学习实现分布式推理与集中输出。

Result: ECON在六个基准测试中平均性能提升11.2%，并具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: ECON为更强大的多LLM集成提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and
lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM
coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic
beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via
Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that
marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each
LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward,
conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly
inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly
tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically,
ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six
benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments
demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models,
confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful
multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: AR-Bench是一个新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的主动推理能力，发现当前模型在主动推理方面表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估被动推理，缺乏对主动推理的系统性研究。

Method: 设计了AR-Bench，包含三类任务（侦探案例、情境谜题和猜数字），模拟真实场景并测试常识、逻辑和符号推理能力。

Result: 当代LLM在主动推理上表现不佳，即使采用高级策略（如树搜索或后训练方法）改进有限。

Conclusion: 需开发新方法（如交互式学习、实时反馈和环境感知目标）以提升主动推理能力。

Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive
reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a
solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with
external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little
systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel
benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.
AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and
guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and
measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning
challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary
LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently
fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap
highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning
abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,
such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest
gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.
Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology
for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time
feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training. The benchmark is
publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/AR-Bench.

Motivation: 现有方法反馈空间受限且缺乏协调训练，导致性能不佳。

Method: 将多轮优化建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出DPSDP算法，通过直接偏好学习训练actor-critic LLM系统。

Result: 在MATH 500基准上，五步优化将准确率从58.2%提升至63.2%。

Conclusion: DPSDP在多智能体协作和分布外泛化方面表现优越。

Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to
boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various
methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic
solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches
often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training
of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we
model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and
introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine
answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically,
DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution.
Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show
improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on
benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases
first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An
ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and
out-of-distribution generalization.

Motivation: 传统强化学习训练推理语言模型依赖于初始探索能力，且模型主要用于教学而非直接部署。因此，需要一种更高效的方法来生成教学材料。

Method: 提出RLTs框架，通过输入问题和解决方案，生成详细解释以指导学生。训练时使用密集奖励，通过测试学生对解释的理解来优化模型。

Result: 7B规模的RLT在竞赛和研究生级任务中表现优于现有方法，且能适应更大规模学生和零样本任务。

Conclusion: RLTs框架显著提升了推理语言模型的效率和可重用性，为强化学习推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for
one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve
its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of
reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and
cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From
these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration
challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs)
focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are
prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to
simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their
students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation
to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In
practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on
competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and
cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of
orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness
when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution
tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning
framework.

Method: 通过线性分类器和稀疏正则化分析激活模式。

Result: 跨任务的激活模式分类器相似性低，支持集几乎不重叠。

Conclusion: 现有方法难以克服任务依赖性，激活模式跨任务聚类明显。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is
still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed
examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess
whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry
of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that
generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes
with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these
approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically
task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that
linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and,
when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint
supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of
probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation
vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when
examined across tasks.

Motivation: 部分域适应问题需要对齐跨域样本并识别异常类，但现有加权框架仅能表征样本级关系，导致对聚类结构探索不足且权重对预测误差敏感。

Method: 提出BUOT模型，通过样本级和类级传输的合作机制，统一表征样本和类级关系，并引入标签感知传输成本以确保局部传输结构。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验验证了BUOT的竞争力。

Conclusion: BUOT模型通过双层次传输框架有效解决了部分域适应问题，提高了知识转移的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain
samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge
transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier
classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label
distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights
can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient
exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the
inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle
these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model
to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a
unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between
sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level
transport provides essential structure information for the class-level
knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative
information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan
provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware
transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation
formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

Result: 实验表明UniVarFL在准确性上优于现有方法，适用于资源受限场景。

Conclusion: UniVarFL是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际联邦学习部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation
when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional
remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur
high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,
we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training
dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model
dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies
during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns
class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,
effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity
Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature
representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability
to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing
methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and
efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in

Result: 实验表明，SwS在7B和32B模型上平均性能分别提升了10.0%和7.7%。

Conclusion: SwS框架无需外部知识蒸馏，通过自我识别和解决弱点，实现了鲁棒的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, such as
mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a
high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the
scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification
answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their
effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies
indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's
capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem
Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and
leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as
questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative
sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these
failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas
in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually
overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation,
our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to
self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance
gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning
benchmarks.

Method: 通过训练LLM进行上下文探索，包括技能链式操作、利用错误轨迹的负梯度以及设计训练课程。

Result: e3方法在1.7B模型上取得了最佳性能，并能够扩展到训练token预算的两倍。

Conclusion: e3方法显著提升了LLM的推理能力，尤其是在长时推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by
utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this
paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard
problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget
they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning
models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is
by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to
effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as
generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses
before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify
three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the
base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with
generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging
"negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,
resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)
coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a
specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our
recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25
scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not
only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

Result: 在现实FL环境中，FedLeak仍能实现高保真数据重构，揭示了FL系统的重大漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究强调了FL系统的隐私脆弱性，并呼吁开发更有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple
clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy,
at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,
several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage
attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to
reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,
contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the
effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as
small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that
clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL
environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance
failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To
alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,
which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient
regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world
FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a
thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this
protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby
underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need
for more effective defense methods.

*Xianquan Yan,Hakan Akgün,Kenji Kawaguchi,N. Duane Loh,Ching Hua Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HSG-12M是首个大规模空间多图数据集，保留了节点间多条几何路径，为几何感知图学习奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基准假设边是非空间且简单的，无法处理物理上不同的路径。HSG-12M填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过Poly2Graph管道，将一维晶体的哈密顿量映射为谱图，生成静态和动态的空间多图。

Result: HSG-12M包含1160万静态和510万动态谱图，展示了多边几何学习的新挑战。

Conclusion: HSG-12M为凝聚态物理等领域的数据驱动科学发现提供了新工具，并建立了代数与图的新联系。

Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing
physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first
large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a
metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two
nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and
5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401
characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential
data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum
on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that
transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions,
we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that
maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with
popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at
scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as
universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices,
forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for
geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific
discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TiViT框架将时间序列转换为图像，利用预训练的Vision Transformers（ViTs）提升时间序列分类性能，达到SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类在医疗和工业中很重要，但公开数据集稀缺限制了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的发展。

Method: 提出TiViT框架，将时间序列转为图像，利用预训练的ViTs提取特征，并通过理论和实验验证其有效性。

Result: TiViT在标准时间序列分类基准上表现优异，且与TSFM表示空间互补，结合后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: TiViT展示了在非视觉领域复用视觉表示的新方向。

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry,
yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by
the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we
propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series
into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision
Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we
theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for
time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens
and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification
benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We
explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate
layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series
classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM
representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further
performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet
another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

TL;DR: 该论文综述了大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理能力上的发展，分为理解与答案生成两阶段，并探讨了提升方法及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学推理是人工智能研究中的核心挑战，LLMs在此领域的进展值得系统总结与探讨。

Method: 通过预训练策略提升理解能力，从直接预测到逐步推理（CoT），并研究训练无关提示到微调方法。

Result: LLMs在数学推理上取得显著进展，但仍面临能力、效率和泛化等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括高级预训练、知识增强、形式化推理框架和元泛化学习范式。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has long represented one of the most fundamental and
challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence research. In recent years,
large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in this area.
This survey examines the development of mathematical reasoning abilities in
LLMs through two high-level cognitive phases: comprehension, where models gain
mathematical understanding via diverse pretraining strategies, and answer
generation, which has progressed from direct prediction to step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We review methods for enhancing mathematical
reasoning, ranging from training-free prompting to fine-tuning approaches such
as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and discuss recent work
on extended CoT and "test-time scaling". Despite notable progress, fundamental
challenges remain in terms of capacity, efficiency, and generalization. To
address these issues, we highlight promising research directions, including
advanced pretraining and knowledge augmentation techniques, formal reasoning
frameworks, and meta-generalization through principled learning paradigms. This
survey tries to provide some insights for researchers interested in enhancing
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and for those seeking to apply these techniques
to other domains.

Motivation: 强化学习在复杂推理任务中潜力巨大，但依赖外部监督限制了其广泛应用。

Result: 在多种推理基准测试中，CoVo性能媲美甚至超越有监督强化学习。

Conclusion: CoVo为无监督推理学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential
in complex reasoning tasks, yet effective training often relies on external
supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a
novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language
Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning
states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct
responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model
likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their
own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other
candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo,
an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a
robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to
promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a
self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason
without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning
benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing
supervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于观测数据的因果发现方法存在局限性，而基于知识的因果发现（如利用变量元数据）虽具潜力，但现有LLM方法结果不稳定，可靠性不足。

Method: 通过识别知识图谱中的信息性元路径子图，并利用学习排序模型优化子图选择，将其融入零样本提示中，提升LLM的因果推理能力。

Result: 在生物医学和开放领域数据集上的实验表明，该方法在F1分数上比基线方法最高提升44.4分。

Conclusion: 结合知识图谱与大语言模型的方法显著提升了基于知识的因果发现的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for
understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based
causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning
over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a
compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data.
However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce
unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal
inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery.
Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and
further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based
models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts,
improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship.
Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores,
evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs. Our code and datasets are available on

Motivation: 随着LLMs在数据科学中的应用日益广泛，评估其作为助手和代理的效果变得重要，但目前研究存在局限性。

Method: 通过文献综述，分析LLM助手和代理在数据科学中的评估现状。

Result: 研究发现评估集中在少数目标导向活动，忽视了数据管理和探索性活动，且缺乏中间协作和任务转换的探讨。

Conclusion: 未来研究应更全面地评估LLMs在数据科学中的作用，包括中间协作和任务转换的可能性。

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making
processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as
assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code
snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation
of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents,
i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such
as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions
and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation
of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on
a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management
and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully
autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI
collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting
the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

Result: 在领域泛化和标签不平衡场景下达到最先进性能，适用于集中式和联邦式设置。

Conclusion: FedTAIL通过优化协调和类感知正则化，有效提升了模型在领域泛化和长尾分布下的性能。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on
unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While
recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,
existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and
conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain
generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through
sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a
gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and
adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class
imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a
curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes
underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution
alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy
regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies
optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional
alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive
evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that
FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of
domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both
centralized and federated settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/FedTail

Result: VIKI-R在所有任务级别上显著优于基线方法，并展现出异构智能体间的组合协作模式。

Conclusion: VIKI-Bench和VIKI-R为视觉驱动的多智能体协作提供了统一的测试平台和方法。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core
challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven
reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have
begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However,
these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse
embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical
benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three
structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception.
VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations,
and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual
inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a
two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM)
using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement
learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that
VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.
Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of
compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together,
VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing
multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法在跨文档语义距离较远时表现不佳，需要一种更高效的方法来整合分散的信息。

Method: 提出了HLG三层索引结构，包括原子命题溯源、潜在主题聚类和实体关系链接，并设计了两种互补的检索方法：StatementGraphRAG和TopicGraphRAG。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，该方法比基于分块的RAG平均提升了23.1%的检索召回率和正确率。

Conclusion: HLG及其检索方法在多跳检索任务中表现优异，开源工具包可供使用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models in
external evidence, yet it still falters when answers must be pieced together
across semantically distant documents. We close this gap with the Hierarchical
Lexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic
proposition to its source, (ii) clusters propositions into latent topics, and
(iii) links entities and relations to expose cross-document paths. On top of
HLG we build two complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG,
which performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for
high-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG, which selects coarse
topics before expanding along entity links to supply broad yet relevant context
for exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity
required to rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing
on single-document queries or limited datasets. To address this, we introduce a
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that curates realistic, multi-document
question-answer pairs, enabling robust evaluation of multi-hop retrieval
systems. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that our
methods outperform naive chunk-based RAG achieving an average relative
improvement of 23.1% in retrieval recall and correctness. Open-source Python
library is available at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

Motivation: 语言模型在自主数据分析中的部署日益增多，但其对数据异常（如缺失值、离群值等）的识别和处理能力尚未充分研究，这些异常可能严重影响分析结论的有效性。

Method: 通过程序化扰动模拟数据异常，构建包含2980个表格查询对的RADAR基准测试，覆盖9个领域和5种异常类型，并系统性地研究表格大小对推理性能的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在无异常表格上表现良好，但在数据异常存在时性能显著下降，暴露了其在稳健数据分析能力上的不足。

Conclusion: RADAR为提升表格推理能力提供了灵活可扩展的资源，支持多样化的扰动类型和可控的表格大小。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly being deployed to perform autonomous
data analyses. However, their data awareness -- the ability to recognize,
reason over, and appropriately handle data artifacts such as missing values,
outliers, and logical inconsistencies -- remains underexplored. These artifacts
are especially common in real-world tabular data and, if mishandled, can
significantly compromise the validity of analytical conclusions. To address
this gap, we present RADAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating
data-aware reasoning on tabular data. We develop a framework to simulate data
artifacts via programmatic perturbations to enable targeted evaluation of model
behavior. RADAR comprises 2980 table query pairs, grounded in real-world data
spanning 9 domains and 5 data artifact types. In addition to evaluating
artifact handling, RADAR systematically varies table size to study how
reasoning performance holds when increasing table size. Our evaluation reveals
that, despite decent performance on tables without data artifacts, frontier
models degrade significantly when data artifacts are introduced, exposing
critical gaps in their capacity for robust, data-aware analysis. Designed to be
flexible and extensible, RADAR supports diverse perturbation types and
controllable table sizes, offering a valuable resource for advancing tabular
reasoning.

Abstract: Financial analysis presents complex challenges that could leverage large
language model (LLM) capabilities. However, the scarcity of challenging
financial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic
innovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible
research resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in
this specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an
open-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance
of LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection,
earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by
downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic
Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels
corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic
regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings
forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to
real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific
adaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is
publicly available to facilitate future research in finance with LLMs.

Motivation: 解决在仿射变换下图像分类的线性可分性问题，并进一步研究其对非仿射变形的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出max-normalized和mean-normalized R-CDT，分析其在水无穷距离和水二距离下的鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验证明了新特征提取器的有效性及其对局部非仿射变形和脉冲噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: max-normalized和mean-normalized R-CDT在多种变形下保持线性可分性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute
feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the
small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and
provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from
translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition
of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine
transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this
issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only
requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary
affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the
max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against
non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its
separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance
between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance
only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a
mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the
Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive
noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical
experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well
as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.

Abstract: Research in neuroscience and vision science relies heavily on careful
measurements of animal subject's gaze direction. Rodents are the most widely
studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage
and hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing
techniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy
to use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been
made in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms,
unfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which
does not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g.,
variability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small
size. To overcome these unique challenges, this work presents a flexible,
robust, and highly accurate model for pupil and corneal reflection
identification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained
to account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a highly
accurate and practical biomedical image segmentation based convolutional neural
network architecture for pupil and corneal reflection identification in eye
images. This new method, in conjunction with our automated infrared videobased
eye recording system, offers the state of the art technology in eye tracking
for neuroscience and vision science research for rodents.

Abstract: High-quality volumetric meshing from medical images is a key bottleneck for
physics-based simulations in personalized medicine. For volumetric meshing of
complex medical structures, recent studies have often utilized deep learning
(DL)-based template deformation approaches to enable fast test-time generation
with high spatial accuracy. However, these approaches still exhibit
limitations, such as limited flexibility at high-curvature areas and
unrealistic inter-part distances. In this study, we introduce a simple yet
effective snap-and-tune strategy that sequentially applies DL and test-time
optimization, which combines fast initial shape fitting with more detailed
sample-specific mesh corrections. Our method provides significant improvements
in both spatial accuracy and mesh quality, while being fully automated and

### [208] [Plug-and-Play Linear Attention for Pre-trained Image and Video Restoration Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08520)
*Srinivasan Kidambi,Pravin Nair*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PnP-Nystra是一种基于Nyström的线性自注意力近似方法，可作为即插即用模块加速预训练的视觉模型，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头自注意力（MHSA）的二次复杂度在实时和资源受限环境中成为计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出PnP-Nystra，作为MHSA的线性近似替代，适用于多种窗口式Transformer架构。

Result: 在图像和视频修复任务中，PnP-Nystra实现了2-5倍加速，PSNR最多仅下降1.5 dB。

Conclusion: PnP-Nystra是首个无需训练的线性注意力替代方案，显著加速模型推理。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) has become a core component in modern
computer vision models. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to input
length poses a significant computational bottleneck in real-time and resource
constrained environments. We propose PnP-Nystra, a Nystr\"om based linear
approximation of self-attention, developed as a plug-and-play (PnP) module that
can be integrated into the pre-trained image and video restoration models
without retraining. As a drop-in replacement for MHSA, PnP-Nystra enables
efficient acceleration in various window-based transformer architectures,
including SwinIR, Uformer, and RVRT. Our experiments across diverse image and
video restoration tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution,
demonstrate that PnP-Nystra achieves a 2-4x speed-up on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU
and a 2-5x speed-up on CPU inference. Despite these significant gains, the
method incurs a maximum PSNR drop of only 1.5 dB across all evaluated tasks. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate a linear attention
functioning as a training-free substitute for MHSA in restoration models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DCD的深度学习模型，用于胎儿心超A4C视图的自动分割，以提高分割精度并减轻超声医师的工作负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿心超A4C视图的精确分割对先天性心脏病的早期诊断至关重要，但由于超声伪影、噪声和解剖变异性等因素，分割仍具挑战性。

Method: DCD模型结合了Dense ASPP模块（用于多尺度特征提取）和CBAM模块（用于增强自适应特征表示），以捕捉局部和全局上下文信息。

Result: DCD实现了精确且鲁棒的分割，有助于提升产前心脏评估的准确性。

Conclusion: DCD模型为胎儿心超A4C视图的分割提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber
(A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and
prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise
segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise,
anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational
stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation
accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic
segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model
incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module,
enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By
effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD
achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal
cardiac assessment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种生物启发的深度学习集成框架，用于同时分类16种胎儿结构，解决了图像质量低、类内变异大和类别不平衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于胎儿超声图像质量低、类内变异大和类别不平衡，准确分类具有挑战性。

Method: 采用双分支（浅层路径和详细路径）的轻量级架构，结合EfficientNet-B0和EfficientNet-B6模型及LDAM-Focal损失函数。

Result: 在5,298张临床图像上测试，90%的器官分类准确率>0.75，75%的器官>0.85，性能优于复杂模型。

Conclusion: 生物启发的模块化堆叠方法在复杂临床环境中实现了鲁棒且可扩展的胎儿解剖识别。

Abstract: Accurate classification of second-trimester fetal ultrasound images remains
challenging due to low image quality, high intra-class variability, and
significant class imbalance. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful,
biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior
studies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously
distinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular
organization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary
branches (a "shallow" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a "detailed"
path for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final
prediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large
number of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and
evaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three
experts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and
variability rather than a "cleaned" dataset. Despite this complexity, our
ensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies
90% of organs with accuracy > 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy >
0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer
categories. These results demonstrate that biologically inspired modular
stacking can yield robust, scalable fetal anatomy recognition in challenging
clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光片是乳腺癌检测的金标准，但AI训练需要大量多样数据，隐私和伦理问题限制了数据获取。

Method: MAMBO采用基于块的扩散模型，结合局部和全局上下文信息，生成高分辨率（3840x3840像素）乳腺X光片。

Result: MAMBO能生成高度真实的乳腺X光片，支持分类模型训练和异常检测，实验验证了其在图像生成、超分辨率和异常检测中的潜力。

Conclusion: MAMBO为乳腺X光片分析提供了新工具，有望提升诊断准确性和早期病变检测能力。

Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast
cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying
abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse
datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical
constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle
mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate
full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in
realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and
none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture
fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates
separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level)
contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based
model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design
enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840
pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of
classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both
numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image
generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential
to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion
detection.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 通过多模态学习提升CBCT到CT的合成质量，显著改善低质量CBCT-CT对齐情况下的图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT虽快速低辐射，但存在伪影和视觉质量低的问题，需通过合成CT（sCT）改善。

Method: 结合术中CBCT与术前CT进行多模态学习，生成sCT，并在真实和合成数据集上验证。

Result: 多模态sCT表现优于单模态基线，尤其在低质量CBCT-CT对齐良好的情况下提升显著。

Conclusion: 多模态sCT在真实临床数据中具有高度可重复性，为CBCT图像质量提升提供有效方案。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for real-time
intraoperative imaging due to its low radiation dose and high acquisition
speed. However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant
artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed
Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we
enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative
CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use
a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT
quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT
consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains
observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate
that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming medicine, with generative AI
models like ChatGPT reshaping perceptions of its potential. This study examines
surgeons' awareness, expectations, and involvement with AI in surgery through
comparative surveys conducted in 2021 and 2024. Two cross-sectional surveys
were distributed globally in 2021 and 2024, the first before an IRCAD webinar
and the second during the annual EAES meeting. The surveys assessed
demographics, AI awareness, expectations, involvement, and ethics (2024 only).
The surveys collected a total of 671 responses from 98 countries, 522 in 2021
and 149 in 2024. Awareness of AI courses rose from 14.5% in 2021 to 44.6% in
2024, while course attendance increased from 12.9% to 23%. Despite this,
familiarity with foundational AI concepts remained limited. Expectations for
AI's role shifted in 2024, with hospital management gaining relevance. Ethical
concerns gained prominence, with 87.2% of 2024 participants emphasizing
accountability and transparency. Infrastructure limitations remained the
primary obstacle to implementation. Interdisciplinary collaboration and
structured training were identified as critical for successful AI adoption.
Optimism about AI's transformative potential remained high, with 79.9% of
respondents believing AI would positively impact surgery and 96.6% willing to
integrate AI into their clinical practice. Surgeons' perceptions of AI are
evolving, driven by the rise of generative AI and advancements in surgical data
science. While enthusiasm for integration is strong, knowledge gaps and
infrastructural challenges persist. Addressing these through education, ethical
frameworks, and infrastructure development is essential.

Conclusion: Step-Audio-AQAA为端到端音频语言模型提供了有效解决方案，并展示了基于标记的声码器在AQAA任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits
their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless
audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully

integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature
extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for
high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved
token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance.
Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that
Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the
state-of-art LALMs in key areas. This work contributes a promising solution for
end-to-end LALMs and highlights the critical role of token-based vocoder in

Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student
learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers
and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that
include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data
are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio
capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and
behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI,
synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as
posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others.
Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and
engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own
evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and
AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of soft tissue deformation is a critical factor
for surgical robotics and medical training. In this paper, we introduce a novel
physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in
a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based
priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage
Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue

of both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural
network predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and
physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate

Conclusion: altiro3D的扩展版本显著提升了3D内容生成的实时性和易用性，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: A new extended version of the altiro3D C++ Library -- initially developed to
get glass-free holographic displays starting from 2D images -- is here
introduced aiming to deal with 3D video streams from either 2D webcam images or
flat video files. These streams are processed in real-time to synthesize
light-fields (in Native format) and feed realistic 3D experiences. The core
function needed to recreate multiviews consists on the use of MiDaS
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to extract a depth map from a
single 2D image. Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing techniques are applied
to improve the overall performance of the extended altiro3D Library. Thus,
altiro3D can now treat standard images, video streams or screen portions of a
Desktop where other apps may be also running (like web browsers, video chats,
etc) and render them into 3D. To achieve the latter, a screen region need to be
selected in order to feed the output directly into a light-field 3D device such
as Looking Glass (LG) Portrait. In order to simplify the acquisition of a
Desktop screen area by the user, a multi-platform Graphical User Interface has
been also implemented. Sources available at:

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，能够重建不同类别的关节物体。

Conclusion: 该方法为关节物体的通用化重建提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their
kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in
embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured
data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and
generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction
of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a
hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an
articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this
setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and
there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers
joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD
video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$
larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11
categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video
as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real
articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos,
outperforming existing methods significantly.

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了几何对齐且物理真实的3D全息场景表示，为全息显示提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling the full properties of light, including both amplitude and phase, in
3D representations is crucial for advancing physically plausible rendering,
particularly in holographic displays. To support these features, we propose a
novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on
intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with
complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light
waves. By leveraging RGBD multi-view images, our method directly optimizes
complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This
eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization.
Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed
improvements while maintaining on-par image quality, representing a first step
towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene
representations.

Conclusion: 该方法在材料选择任务中表现优异，适用于下游编辑任务。

Abstract: Selection is the first step in many image editing processes, enabling faster
and simpler modifications of all pixels sharing a common modality. In this
work, we present a method for material selection in images, robust to lighting
and reflectance variations, which can be used for downstream editing tasks. We
rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for
selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer
and more stable selection results than prior methods. Furthermore, we enable
selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level
material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over
800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.

Abstract: In this work, we approach spoken Dialogue State Tracking (DST) by bridging
the representation spaces of speech encoders and LLMs via a small connector
module, with a focus on fully open-sourced and open-data components
(WavLM-large, OLMo). We focus on ablating different aspects of such systems
including full/LoRA adapter fine-tuning, the effect of agent turns in the
dialogue history, as well as fuzzy matching-based output post-processing, which
greatly improves performance of our systems on named entities in the dialogue
slot values. We conduct our experiments on the SpokenWOZ dataset, and
additionally utilize the Speech-Aware MultiWOZ dataset to augment our training
data. Ultimately, our best-performing WavLM + connector + OLMo-1B aligned
models achieve state of the art on the SpokenWOZ test set (34.66% JGA), and our
system with Gemma-2-9B-instruct further surpasses this result, reaching 42.17%
JGA on SpokenWOZ test.

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain
alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus
settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to
generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.
However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily
focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal
models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain
alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity
recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with
audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized
instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned
MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that
instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned
multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for
both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear
disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise
differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find
that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas
showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and
language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide
clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the
alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping
joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly
available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

TL;DR: GradEscape是一种基于梯度的攻击方法，针对AI生成文本检测器，通过加权嵌入和反馈优化实现高效攻击，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成文本检测器的不可微计算问题和分词器不匹配问题，提升攻击效果。

Method: 引入加权嵌入和反馈优化，采用暖启动和分词器推理技术，适应不同语言模型架构。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上表现优异，参数效率高，成功应用于商业检测器。

Conclusion: 揭示了训练数据表达风格差异是主要漏洞，提出了防御策略，并开源了GradEscape。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GradEscape, the first gradient-based evader
designed to attack AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors. GradEscape overcomes the
undifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by
introducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector
input. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim
detectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To
address the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we
introduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to
detectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel
tokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective
evasion even in query-only access.
  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language
models, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.
Experimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders
in various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing
only 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world
commercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability
stems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We
also propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT
evaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT
detectors.

TL;DR: PhyBlock是一个用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在3D块组装任务中物理理解和规划能力的渐进式基准测试，揭示了VLMs在高级规划和推理能力上的显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在结构化3D环境中的物理现象理解能力有限，需要一种评估工具来推动其在具身推理中的发展。

Method: PhyBlock结合了四层次认知层次组装任务和视觉问答（VQA）样本，通过2600个任务评估模型在部分完成、故障诊断和规划鲁棒性三个维度的表现。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs在高级规划和推理能力上表现有限，尤其在空间定向和依赖关系推理方面存在困难，且链式思维提示效果甚微。

Conclusion: PhyBlock为连接视觉语言理解和现实世界物理问题解决提供了一个统一的测试平台。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities
in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend
physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains
severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive
benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning
through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level
cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering
(VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning
and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial
relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block
tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three
key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness.
We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and
limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings
indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in
high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in
performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals
persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning.
Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements,
suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We
position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging
vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.
